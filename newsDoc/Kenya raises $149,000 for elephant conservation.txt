Kenya raises $149,000 for elephant conservation
Kenya on Saturday announced that it has raised 16.5 million shillings ($149,000) toward the conservation of elephants against the target of $900,000 within the current financial year that ends in June 2022.

"This is certainly a great milestone for Kenya, and this initiative will go a long way in ensuring that elephants are protected in Kenya, not only for ourselves but also for the future generations," Najib Balala, cabinet secretary of the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife said on Saturday.

Balala made the remarks during the inaugural Magical Kenya Tembo Naming Festival that took place at the Amboseli National Park in Kenya.

The Amboseli National Park is located at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro and has seen an increase in elephant births over the past few months.

According to Kenya's National Wildlife Census 2021 Report, the East African nation is home to 36,280 elephants, representing a 21 percent growth from 2014, when poaching was at its peak.
