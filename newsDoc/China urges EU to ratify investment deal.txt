China urges EU to ratify investment deal
China's ambassador to the European Union has urged the bloc not to allow politics to disrupt mutually beneficial economic agreements such as the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment.

The ratification of that accord, negotiated almost a year ago, has been held up since the European Parliament refused to consider it as a result of Chinese sanctions on a group of MEPs.

Under the deal, both Brussels and Beijing promised to ensure fair treatment and greater opportunities to businesses from each side.

Zhang Ming, China's ambassador to the EU, said companies were keen for the deal to be put into action and have been frustrated by the failure to sign it off, which he said China was ready to do.

"I regret to see that because of obstacles caused by the European side, its ratification has hit the rocks. I learned that both our economic communities have been calling for breaking the deadlock and ratifying the agreement as soon as possible ... What's most important, I think, is to return to the nature of the agreement, which concerns trade and economic cooperation," he said in a web chat arranged by the European Policy Centre.
