Cat hunts rodent in the wilderness of NW China's Xinjiang
An orange-and-white cat, which belongs to an ethnic Kazakh herder in the Altay region in northwest China's Xinjiang, caught a rodent then proceeded to toss it in the air and bat at it before delivering the final ¨C and fatal ¨C blow. Cats tend to do that by instinct to wear out and weaken their prey so they don't fight or bite back.
