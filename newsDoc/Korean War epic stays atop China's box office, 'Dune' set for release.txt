Korean War epic stays atop China's box office, 'Dune' set for release
China saw a decline in its domestic box office earnings last week (October 11-17) after the profitable National Day holiday concluded earlier this month, taking in 1.04 billion yuan (about $157 million), according to the movie ticketing platform Maoyan.

"The Battle at Lake Changjin," a historic epic on the battle of the Chinese People's Volunteers (CPV) army in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea (1950-1953), remained as the week's top winner with ticket sales of 799 million yuan, accounting for over 75 percent of the total.

The film is now this year's second highest-grossing film across the world, so far raking in 4.97 billion yuan, as the box office tracking website Box Office Mojo shows.

There are three Chinese movies on the chart of top 10 worldwide box office of 2021. The other two are "Hi, Mom" and "Detective Chinatown 3," both released during the Chinese New Year holiday in February.
