Venezuela attempts to set a world orchestral record
Venezuela attempted to set the world record for the world¡¯s largest orchestra with a goal of 12,000 musicians. Thousands of people, mostly children and adolescents, played their instruments at the country's military academy.

The piece they played was Tchaikovsky's "Slavonic March". The Guinness World Records will determine within 10 days whether the orchestra set a record. They would need to have more than 8,097 musicians playing at once.
