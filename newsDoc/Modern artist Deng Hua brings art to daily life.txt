Modern artist Deng Hua brings art to daily life

Modern art has become increasingly popular in China over the past 20 years, with many artists trying to blend tradition and modernity. Deng Hua is one of the artists lucky enough to be a part of this trend. He gained fame at various expos across China, offering products with a nice mix of tradition and modernity.

"The handmade tea trays are my handicrafts," said Deng. "They are made of resin and red sandalwood. Chinese people like drinking tea and tea trays are frequently used. I want to create something that's in line with people's habits and also reflects modern aesthetics." Deng's workshop is located amid furniture factories in Dacheng County, north China's Hebei Province. He often stays in the courtyard house with the wood and his tools for days, alone.

"Each piece goes through more than 20 procedures and takes about 20 days to make. When you cut a 2-meter-long trunk, you'll find that most of the patterns are ordinary. There will be few with burls or patterns like undulating mountains. I look for patterns like these and then think about what colors of resin should be used to match, what kind of pattern I should carve on it and what size it should be."

The most difficult part in the process is figuring out how to blend the resin into the wood and make sure the whole piece does not crack in the long run. And Deng has spent three years solving this problem. "I think resin is very expressive, you can make it into any shape and any color. It looks like plastic, but wood gives it a gentle touch. The combination of the two fits modern aesthetics."
