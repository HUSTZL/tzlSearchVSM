California reopens, lifts most coronavirus restrictions
The U.S. state of California is passing another threshold in its fight against COVID-19.

The nation's most populous state is set to fully reopen on June 15th, lifting nearly all of its coronavirus restrictions that have been in place for over a year.

The move follows a trend of overall low positivity rates and high vaccination rates across the state.

What will change and what does this mean for the state's economy?
