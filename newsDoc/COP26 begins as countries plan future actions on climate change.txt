COP26 begins as countries plan future actions on climate change
The opening ceremony of the world leaders' summit at the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) started on Monday, with over 120 world leaders gathered in Glasgow, Scotland.

COP26 was delayed by a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic and is the first conference after the five-year review cycle under the Paris Agreement inked in 2015.

"We postponed COP26 by a year. But during that year, climate change did not take time off. And we know that the window to keep 1.5 degrees within reach is closing," said COP26 President Alok Sharma in his speech at the opening ceremony.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, in his opening address, warned world leaders that they faced a damning verdict from future generations unless they act decisively.

"The anger and the impatience of the world will be uncontainable, unless we make this COP26 in Glasgow the moment when we get real about climate change, and we can get real on coal, cars, cash and trees," Johnson said.
