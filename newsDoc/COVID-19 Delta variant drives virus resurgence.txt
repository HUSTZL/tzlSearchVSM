COVID-19 Delta variant drives virus resurgence
With the more contagious Delta variant spreading across the U.S., new COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations are rising around the country.

States with low vaccination rates are fueling the rise, with Florida and Texas emerging as COVID-19 hotspots.

Last week the two states accounted for one-third of new cases nationwide, according to White House pandemic response coordinator Jeff Zients.

Florida reported 21,683 cases on Saturday, breaking the state's record for new cases reported in a single day since the pandemic began.

The governors of Florida and Texas have both rallied against mask mandates and approved bans on such mandates in their states.

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis' ban on school districts issuing mask mandates includes a further provision to deny state funding to a district that defies the ban.

Meanwhile, New York City is requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination for people entering indoor spaces such as restaurants, gyms and entertainment venues.

NYC is the first city to require proof of at least one vaccine shot to participate in these activities.

"It's time for people to see vaccination as literally necessary to living a good and full and healthy life," said NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio at a news conference on Tuesday.

Mayor de Blasio is also requiring city workers get vaccinated or get tested for COVID-19 weekly.
