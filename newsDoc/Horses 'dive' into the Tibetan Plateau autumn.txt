Horses 'dive' into the Tibetan Plateau autumn
With the autumn wave gradually submerging the mountains and valleys of Kangding, Tibetan horses seem like they are diving into the golden world of the Tibetan Plateau.

Kangding is the capital of Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in southwest China's Sichuan Province. The ancient city was an important spot of the Tea Horse Road, and horses are a part of the locals' lives. Every year in the summer, the local Tibetans will host a horse racing festival to ride their favorite horses freely on the green land.
