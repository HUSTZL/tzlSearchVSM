Ahead of Olympics, Beijing school gives a taste of winter sports
01:32

At a small school in western Beijing, students can be seen touring the courtyard on roller skis, or practicing biathlon shooting. At the back of the school is a full-scale perfectly maintained curling rink that is operational all year round, even by 35 degrees Celsius in the summer. Dianchang Road Primary School is not a sports school but has been offering winter sports as part of its activity program for the past three years, in line with China's push to get more people interested in ice and snow sports ahead of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics.

Approximately 300 students, aged 6-12, get to experience a variety of sports at the school ¨C from ice hockey to cross-country skiing, speed skating and curling ¨C often for the first time. The goal is not necessarily to create champions (although some students have enrolled in competitions and a few have won regional trophies), but to get young people interested in winter sports, says sports teacher Shi Xiaojun. The school's equipment, funded by the government or donated by sports associations, is impressive, with laser biathlon rifles and targets, cross-country skis and boots, and heavy curling stones and brushes.
