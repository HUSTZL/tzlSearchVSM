The year 2020 was the deadliest year for refugees crossing the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea, according to a new report from the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR). These routes are the most popular among Rohingya refugees trying to reach Southeast Asia from Bangladesh. The reports says 218 people died or went missing at sea last year. Officials said 2,413 people attempted the journey. The UNHCR notes that many countries tightened their borders because of COVID-19, which left many refugees stranded.
