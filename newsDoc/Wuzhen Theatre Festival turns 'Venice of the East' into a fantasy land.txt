Wuzhen Theatre Festival turns 'Venice of the East' into a fantasy land
Directors, artists and drama fans are flocking to this year's Wuzhen Theatre Festival. Located in eastern China, this small water town, dubbed as the "Venice of the East," is hosting the annual event.

The event will stage 23 selected dramas. Among these plays, the impressive lineup includes works of two famous directors, Stan Lai and Meng Jinghui, who are both co-founders of this festival. Lai will bring his new piece named "Ago," and Meng has a remake of the renowned French play "Le Rouge et le Noir" ("The Red and the Black"). The event will also stage Shakespeare's drama, "Hamlet."

Other events include a competition for emerging artists in which 18 teams will compete for the "Best Play," "Best Individual Performance" and a special award.
