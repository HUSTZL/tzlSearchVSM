During the first telephone conversation with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko proposed to create a humanitarian corridor so that 2,000 migrants could get to Germany, Lukashenko's press secretary Natalya Eismont said on Thursday.

According to Eismont, there are about 7,000 refugees in Belarus, and about 2,000 are at the border. Only 400 refugees agreed to return to their homeland. Other migrants continue to insist on providing them with a humanitarian corridor to Western Europe, primarily to Germany.

On the EU side, Eismont said, not a single commitment has yet been fulfilled. The European Union has not even started negotiations at the expert level yet, as Lukashenko and Merkel agreed on during the second conversation.

Thousands of refugees, most of them coming from the Middle East, are trying to enter Poland, Lithuania and other EU countries from Belarus. On November 8, thousands of refugees seeking asylum in Germany camped on the border with Poland.
