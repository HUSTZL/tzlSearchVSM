China opposes Taiwan 'representative office' in Lithuania
A Chinese mainland spokesperson on Friday voiced firm opposition to Taiwan region's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authority's acts seeking "Taiwan independence" after a "Taiwanese Representative Office in Lithuania" was launched. China firmly opposes all forms of official interactions between the Taiwan region and countries having diplomatic ties with China, Zhu Fenglian, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, told the press.

The DPP authority, out of its separatist intent, has been undermining the one-China principle and conducting separatist acts on the international stage, Zhu said. She urged relevant countries to abide by the one-China principle, prudently handle Taiwan-related affairs and not go too far on the wrong path in supporting "Taiwan independence."
