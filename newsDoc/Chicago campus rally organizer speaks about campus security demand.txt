Chicago campus rally organizer speaks about campus security demand
Hundreds of students and faculty members have gathered on the University of Chicago campus, calling for justice and better security after a Chinese student was fatally shot in an apparent robbery last week.

CGTN spoke to one of the rally organizers, Han Jiaxiu, who said an upgrade in safety measures is critical, especially for international students on campus.
