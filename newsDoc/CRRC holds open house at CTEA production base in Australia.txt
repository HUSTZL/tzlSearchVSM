CRRC holds open house at CTEA production base in Australia
CRRC Corporation Limited (CRRC) recently held an online open house at the CRRC Times Electric Australia Pty Ltd (CTEA), showcasing the company's cooperation with local enterprises.

CRRC launched a production base in Melbourne, Australia, in 2018, committing to manufacturing, purchasing, recruitment, maintenance, repairing and management locally. It is mainly responsible for traction system production, in-operation subway train adjustment and component after-sale service.

The production base has brought fresh blood to the Australian automobile industry and created jobs for local people, contributing to the region's economic transformation.
