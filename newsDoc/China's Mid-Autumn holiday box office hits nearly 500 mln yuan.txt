China's box office raked in over 498 million yuan ($77 million) during this year's Mid-Autumn Festival holiday (September 19-21), according to the data from box office tracking platform Beacon on Wednesday. The figure was 38.18 percent lower than that of the same period in 2019 before COVID-19 struck, hitting its lowest since 2018. Data also shows that nearly 13.4 million movie tickets, including in the pre-sale period, were sold for a record 1.23 million screenings during the three-day holiday, a usually busy period for Chinese cinemas.

Domestic disaster movie "Cloudy Mountain" topped this year's Mid-Autumn Festival holiday box office with 214 million yuan in ticket sales, accounting for over 40 percent of the total.
