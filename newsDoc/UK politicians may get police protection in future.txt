Members of Parliament (MPs) are likely to be offered police protection or private security guards at their weekly constituency surgeries following the murder of Conservative party member David Amess.

Safety arrangements have been under constant review since the murder of MP Jo Cox in 2016 and already many MPs have increased security at their homes and private offices, including new locks, closed circuit television and in some cases, panic alarms.

Kim Leadbeater, the sister of Cox and now a Labour MP herself, said her partner had asked her to step down after the killing of Amess.

"There are other options that are being considered," said Home Secretary Priti Patel on Sunday, "such as when you hold your surgeries, you have officers or some kind of protection."

Some MPs have already held surgeries this weekend with a police officer present, but the actual practice of meeting constituents face-to-face is unlikely to change. Parliamentarians admit to being torn between the need to protect their health and well-being and the clear imperative to maintain as much personal contact with constituents as possible.

The overall review of future procedures is almost certain to take time and will be subject to some vigorous debate.

The 25-year-old man in custody has been identified as Ali Harbi Ali according to reports in the UK media. He's believed to be a British citizen of Somali heritage.
