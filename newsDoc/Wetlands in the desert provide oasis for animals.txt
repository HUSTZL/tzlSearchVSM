Wetlands in the desert provide oasis for animals
The Kanglayka Lakes area sits in the intersection area of the Taklimakan Desert, the Kumtag Desert and Lop Nur in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. The Kanglayka Lakes consist of 11 different lakes, with clean water, abundant fish, shrimps and crabs. The wetlands nearby provide an oasis for terrestrial animals in the desert.
