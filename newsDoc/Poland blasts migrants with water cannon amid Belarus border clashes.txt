Poland blasts migrants with water cannon amid Belarus border clashes
Polish forces have fired tear gas and water cannon at migrants trying to cross the border with Belarus, which has led to an escalation of the ongoing dispute between the two nations.

Up to 4,000 migrants are estimated to be currently camped out on the Belarus side of the border. There were reports of stones being thrown at Polish border guards, which prompted the use of water cannon despite the freezing conditions.

"Migrants attacked our soldiers and officers with rocks and are trying to destroy the fence and cross into Poland," according to the defense ministry, which also tweeted a video showing apparent clashes at the border.

"Our forces used tear gas to quell the migrants' aggression."

Of the 15,000 Polish troops deployed to the border, officials have reported a police officer, a border guard and a soldier have been injured in the clashes.

Belarus has responded, accusing Poland of exacerbating the problem. Foreign ministry spokesman Anatoly Glaz said: "We see today from the Polish side direct provocations and inhumane treatment of the disadvantaged."
