Exploring rare plants on plateau in SW China
Mount Siguniang National Nature Reserve is situated in southwest China's Sichuan Province in the transitional zone between Sichuan Basin and the Tibetan Plateau. It is one of the richest regions of alpine vegetation and biodiversity in the world and houses well-preserved glacial landforms. It is home to steep mountains, with 85 snow peaks above 5,000 meters. Among them, Yaomei Peak, with an elevation of 6,250 meters, is the main peak of the Qionglai Mountains.

In this video, Yang Han, a biodiversity conservation personnel from the Mount Siguniang National Nature Reserve Administration, goes as high as 4,500 meters above sea level to find precious plants in the reserve, including Saussurea balangshanensis Zhang Y.Z. & Sun H, a very rare plant native to Balang Mountains, and Saussurea medusa. Will he be able to find these plants? Check the video to see more.
