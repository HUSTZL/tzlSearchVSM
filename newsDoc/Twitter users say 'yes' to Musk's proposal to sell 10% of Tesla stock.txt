Twitter users say 'yes' to Musk's proposal to sell 10% of Tesla stock
Tesla Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Elon Musk should sell about 10 percent of his Tesla stock, according to 57.9 percent of people who voted on his Twitter poll asking users of the social media network whether he should offload the stake.

"I was prepared to accept either outcome," Musk said, after the voting ended.

The world's richest person tweeted on Saturday that he would offload 10 percent of his stock if users approved the proposal. Musk has previously said he would have to exercise a large number of stock options in the next three months, which would create a big tax bill. Selling some of his stock could free up funds to pay the taxes.

As of June 30, Musk's shareholding in Tesla came to about 170.5 million shares and selling 10 percent would amount to nearly $21 billion based on Friday's closing, according to Reuters calculations.

The poll garnered more than 3.5 million votes.
