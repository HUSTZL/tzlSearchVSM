University town becomes epicenter of China's Dalian outbreak
It's been over 10 days since a local COVID-19 case was detected in northeast China's coastal city of Dalian amid the country's latest wave of infections. The seaport city this week accounted for most of the mainland's daily caseload. Officials say it is now clear that the epicenter of China's latest COVID-19 outbreak is a college town in Zhuanghe, where at least nine rounds of testing have already been conducted and thousands of students have been transferred to centralized quarantine facilities.
