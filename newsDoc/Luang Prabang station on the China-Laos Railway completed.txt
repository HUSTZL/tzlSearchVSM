With a floor area of 7,970 square meters, the station is the second-largest in Laos after the capital Vientiane station. Luang Prabang Railway Station is located in Luang Prabang Province, the famous cultural capital and Buddhist center of Laos. Integrated with the Buddhist architectural modeling of Xiangthong Temple, the lotus pattern of the Royal Museum, and mountain modeling of Laos and Buddhist murals, the railway station has great cultural characteristics.

Luang Prabang, an L-shaped half-island at the confluence of the Nam Kang and Mekong rivers, is a quaint little town of less than 10 square kilometers. Located more than 500 kilometers from the capital Vientiane, it is the oldest surviving town in Laos, dating back more than 1,000 years. In December 1995, Luang Prabang was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage City for both Nature and Culture.
