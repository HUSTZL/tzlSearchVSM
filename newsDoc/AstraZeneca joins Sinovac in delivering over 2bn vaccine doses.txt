AstraZeneca joins Sinovac in delivering over 2bn vaccine doses
Some 2.12 billion doses of CoronaVac, the COVID-19 vaccine produced by China-based Sinovac have been delivered to date, according to life sciences consultancy Airfinity.

The achievement backed up the words of Zheng Zeguang, China's Ambassador to the UK, who in September noted China's donation of "COVID control supplies to more than 150 countries and 13 international organizations."

On Tuesday, the scientists behind the AstraZeneca-Ox COVID-19 vaccine announced they had also exceeded 2 billion doses delivered.

The shot, which is the biggest contributor to the COVAX vaccine-sharing scheme backed by the World Health Organization, is being made in 15 countries for supply to more than 170 countries, London-listed AstraZeneca and Oxford University said in a joint statement.

AstraZeneca in June last year signed on India's Serum Institute, the world's biggest manufacturer of vaccines by volume, to help double the manufacturing capacity of the jab to 2 billion doses.

Pascal Soriot, AstraZeneca CEO, said it was a "proud day and testament to what can be achieved when we all work together."

The vaccine produced by Pfizer and BioNTech is nearing the milestone, with 1.96 billion doses delivered, reports Airfinity.
