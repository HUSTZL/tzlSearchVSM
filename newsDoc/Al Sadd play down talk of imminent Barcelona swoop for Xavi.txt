Al Sadd play down talk of imminent Barcelona swoop for Xavi
Qatari club Al Sadd on Friday responded to speculation that Xavi Hernandez could very soon be appointed as the new coach of Barcelona, insisting that the Spaniard remains "fully focused" on his current club.

"In response to what's circulating recently, the #AlSadd management reaffirms that Xavi has a two-year contract with the club and is fully focused on the team's upcoming matches, to maintain our lead at the top of the league and to defend the title," tweeted the Doha-based outfit.



The 41-year-old, who is due to take charge of his team's game in the Qatar Stars League on Saturday, is under contract with Al Sadd until 2023.

He has been tipped to return to the club where he starred as a player and take over as coach following the sacking earlier this week of Dutchman Ronald Koeman due to a poor run of results.

Earlier reports from The Guardian suggested that Xavi had accepted the offer from Barcelona and the deal is due to be confirmed once agreement is reached to terminate his contract with Al Sadd.
