Young voices take center stage at Wuzhen Theatre Festival
Young artists are burgeoning at the Wuzhen Theatre Festival, which is taking place at the famous water town in east China's Zhejiang Province. Veteran director-producer and festival co-founder, Stan Lai, says new directorial voices are likely to bring fresh ideas and approaches to theater.

Many directors featured at the festival are from the Emerging Young Artists Competition, a major part of the event. Among them is Ding Yiteng, who will bring his play "Reflection," which is inspired by Oscar Wilde's classic novel "The Picture of Dorian Grey." It combines Eastern aesthetics with Western philosophical thinking, offering a glimpse into China's theater industry.
