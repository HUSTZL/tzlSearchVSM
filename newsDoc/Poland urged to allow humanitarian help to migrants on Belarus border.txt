Poland urged to allow humanitarian help to migrants on Belarus border
Humanitarian help for migrants at the Poland-Belarus border must be allowed, volunteer groups have told the Polish government.

Thousands of migrants from West Asia and Africa are sheltering in freezing conditions in the woods on the border between Belarus and the European Union states Poland and Lithuania, which are refusing to let them cross. Some have already died and there are fears for the safety of the rest as bitter winter conditions settle in.

"I'm calling on the government of the Republic of Poland to allow professional non-governmental institutions to operate in the border zone," said Michal Sutyniec, of the Polish network of NGOs Grupa Granica. He added: "So that I would not have to leave a five-year-old girl with her mother in the forest for the night only because it is the best of all the bad variants that are available."

The plea came as Turkey banned Syrian, Yemeni and Iraqi citizens from flights to Minsk on Friday, potentially closing off one of the main routes the EU claims Belarus has used to fly in migrants by the thousands to engineer a humanitarian crisis on its frontier.

Belarus denies it has fomented the crisis, but has also said it cannot help resolve it unless Europe lifts existing sanctions. The EU imposed several rounds of measures in response to President Alexander Lukashenko's violent crackdown on mass street protests against his rule in 2020.
