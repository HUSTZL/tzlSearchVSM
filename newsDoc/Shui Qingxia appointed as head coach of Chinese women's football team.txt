The Chinese Football Association (CFA) announced on its website on Thursday that it has officially appointed Shui Qingxia as head coach of the Chinese national women's football team.

The CFA said it made its decision after comprehensive consideration and careful study.

The 54-year-old Shui, who already coached the national players under the name United Team at National Games in Xi'an in September, succeeds Jia Xiuquan, who parted with the team in October after its disastrous performance at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.
