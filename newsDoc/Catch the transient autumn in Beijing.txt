Catch the transient autumn in Beijing
Autumn has been pretty short in Beijing this year, as the year's first snow is forecast for tonight and tomorrow. Before bidding farewell to the season, let's enjoy the tranquil autumn scenery at Beijing's Five Pagoda Temple, built during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).

The two ginkgo trees inside the temple grounds are as ancient as the building itself. The trees, which endow a golden color to the pagodas, are said to be over 600 years old.
