Domestic tourism booms during National Day holiday
Domestic tourism is booming in China during the ongoing National Day holiday between October 1 and 7, known colloquially as "Golden Week."

A total of 10.5 million passengers are expected to travel by train, and an additional 640 passenger trains will be added to meet the demand on Sunday, the third day of the weeklong National Day holidays, according to China Railway, the country's railway operator. China's railways handled 11.732 million passengers on October 2, running an additional 917 trains.



In east China's Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, tourists were amazed by performances that featured ancient folk customs. "I've taken my child here to feel our National Day holiday atmosphere and the charm of ancient Chinese culture," said Yang Rui, a tourist.



Some tourists chose to immerse themselves in nature at a time when northern and central China ushers in the year's golden autumn foliage.



Others went paragliding or on hot air balloon rides to survey the magnificent nepheline landforms near Zhangye City in northwest China's Gansu Province.



In Qingzhou County of east China's Shandong Province, elderly tourists enjoyed oceans of flowers at greenhouses that boast 100-plus varieties.



In Shanghai, residents gushed praise for a recently rejuvenated river bank. "The bank makes it more convenient for us to do physical exercise and have family activities, which has historical significance. The changes are great," said Ji Shanshan, a Shanghai resident.



The Ministry of Culture and Tourism and the National Health Commission have reminded tourists to wear masks, wash their hands and maintain social distancing whenever possible.
