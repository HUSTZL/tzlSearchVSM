PSG's Aminata Diallo arrested after attack on club teammate
Aminata Diallo, French midfielder of Paris Saint-Germain's women's football team, was arrested for an alleged connection to an attack on her teammate, the club said on Wednesday.

"Paris Saint-Germain acknowledges that Aminata Diallo was remanded in police custody this morning by the Versailles SRPJ (Service R¨¦gional de Police Judiciaire) as part of the proceedings initiated following an assault last Thursday evening against the club's players," PSG said in a statement, but they did not reveal the name of the victim.

According to ESPN, Kheira Hamraoui was the victim of the assault. She and the other two teammates were in Diallo's car after having dinner at the club on November 4. When they reached Hamraoui's home, two men wearing balaclavas dragged her out of the car and began to hit her in the legs with iron bars they brought. The perpetrators left in about two minutes.
