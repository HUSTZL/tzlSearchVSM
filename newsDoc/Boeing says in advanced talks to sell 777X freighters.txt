The U.S. plane maker is poised to launch what would be the world's largest twin-engined freight plane as European rival Airbus seeks buyers for an A350 cargo version.

Boeing is also sticking to plans to deliver its delayed 777X passenger version in 2023, Ihssane Mounir, senior vice-president of commercial sales and marketing, said.

Speaking at a news conference on the eve of the Dubai Airshow, Mounir said a recovery in commercial flying had achieved a "strong foothold" after COVID-19 lockdowns.

Qatar Airways has said publicly it is in negotiations with Boeing on the possible purchase of a 777X freighter, while FedEx is widely seen as another potential early buyer.

Ted Colbert, president and CEO of Boeing Global Services; Michael Manazir, vice-president of Business Development for Defence, Space and Security; and Ihssane Mounir, senior vice-president of Commercial Sales & Marketing, shared their views for regional demand and emphasised Boeing's commitment to deepen its regional presence.
