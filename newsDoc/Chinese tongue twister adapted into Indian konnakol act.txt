Chinese tongue twister adapted into Indian konnakol act
Konnakol is the art of vocal percussion in traditional Indian music. As the equivalent to beatboxing, konnakol performer Rishabh Dhar was invited to interpret a Chinese tongue twister with his own beats and style.

The performance caught the eyes of many online viewers during CGTN's online virtual concert "The Bridge" on October 29, 2021. Other than Rishabh Dhar, the cross-cultural performance also included artists from China and India pairing skills on the same stage with the aim of achieving a soulful connection through music.
