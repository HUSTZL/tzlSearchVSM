Honoring loved ones and COVID-19 victims for Day of the Dead
People across Latin America are honoring their loved ones in celebration of Day of the Dead. The holiday known for decorated skulls and bright colored flowers, honors dead loved ones and dates back to the Aztec empire. Family and friends set up elaborate altars with some of the favorite foods and items of the deceased.

While many celebrate at home or at the gravesites of those they love, some cities host parades and other large events in honor of the holiday. After last year's cancellation because of COVID-19, Mexico City brought back their Day of the Dead parade. This year, festivities honored the deaths of millions during the COVID-19 pandemic.
