Djokovic presented with year-end ATP No.1 trophy
Five-time champion Novak Djokovic began his attempt to equal Roger Federer's record number of ATP Finals triumphs on Monday with a straight-sets 7-6 (7-4), 6-2 win over Casper Ruud. After his match, Djokovic was presented with the trophy for finishing the year ranked No. 1, a feat he accomplished for a record seventh time ¨C breaking a tie with childhood idol Pete Sampras. Djokovic attracted wild applause from the Turin crowd when he insisted on speaking in Italian for his on-court interview.

"It's one of the most difficult things to do in our sport, to finish No. 1 at the end of the year, you have to play really well, consistently and with a lot of success throughout the year on every surface. I'm very proud," the 34-year-old Serb said.



He added that he did not have a number in mind for how many more years he wants to play.



"I don't want to impose a limit to myself at all, because I still enjoy playing tennis, and I really enjoy competition and playing at the highest level," the 20-time Grand Slam champion said. "Being No. 1 in the world, there is no reason for me yet to think about leaving tennis. I really am in a good place at the moment."
