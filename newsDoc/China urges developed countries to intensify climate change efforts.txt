China urges developed countries to intensify climate change efforts
A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson on Wednesday urged developed countries to intensify their efforts to fulfill their commitments to developing countries on climate change, to make due contributions to climate change response and global climate governance.

Noting that developed countries are the main parties responsible for climate change and historical carbon emissions, spokesperson Wang Wenbin said it is their unshakable moral duty and international obligation under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement to provide finance to developing countries to help with their response to climate change.

"Finance is the key to solving the climate change problem, and developed countries fulfilling financial commitments represents a major concern for developing countries," Wang said, adding that at the Copenhagen and Cancun summits developed countries pledged to jointly mobilize $100 billion every year by 2020.

However, Wang said that over the past decade and more, developed countries have failed to earnestly fulfill the commitment, and the effective finance provided by these developed countries was, in reality, far below their official statistics.
