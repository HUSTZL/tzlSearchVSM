Digital payments firm Alipay has signed an eight-year deal with the sport's governing body in Europe, UEFA, to become the official global payment partner for its tournaments. "Football is a universal, global language and it can also help us bridge all kind of people around the world," said Aaron Wang, general manager of sports, culture and entertainment at Ant Group, which operates Alipay. "We really think the Europe market is important but it's also about improving the spectator experience. For example, in these 11 stadiums across the continent [where games are being played] the fans in there can use Alipay." Wang said the Hangzhou-based firm "is open" to similar deals in other sports, such as "basketball, badminton and table-tennis," with a focus on making life easier for fans.
