Remains of a toothless, two-legged dinosaur species that lived some 70 million years ago have been discovered in Brazil, researchers said Thursday, calling it a "very rare" find.

The small dinosaur, which measured about a meter long and 80 centimeters tall, is a theropod, a group whose members were almost all believed to be carnivores.

But puzzlingly, the new species ¨C dubbed Berthasaura leopoldinae ¨C has a beak-like mouth with no teeth.

"That was a real surprise," the paleontologists who made the find said in a statement released by Brazil's National Museum.
