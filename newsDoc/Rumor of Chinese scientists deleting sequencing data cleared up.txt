Rumor of Chinese scientists deleting sequencing data cleared up
In early 2020, Chinese researchers at Wuhan University submitted their new coronavirus sequencing method to the international academic journal Small. The related sequences taken from 34 patients were also uploaded to an online database maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH). One year later, an American virologist found himself unable to find the data while researching the virus. Did Chinese scientists delete genetic sequences data related to COVID-19 patients?
