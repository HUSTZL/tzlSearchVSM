Cultural industries fair highlights high-quality development
The International Cultural Industries Fair (ICIF) is coming to its 17th edition in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, with focus on high-quality growth and placing more economic value on cultural resources.

It is the country's only comprehensive cultural event seen as an indicator of development trends of the cultural industry. It is going offline and on-site this year.

Nearly 2,500 organizations and companies joined offline. Municipal governments from across the country gave their interpretations of how tourism and culture go hand in hand. One of them is the city of Yan'an, which is famous as a point of reference for modern Chinese history.

"Yan'an is currently looking for ways to turn its iconic culture into economic value. The hall here showcases some outcomes of those efforts so far," Feng Lu from the Strategic Management Department of Yan'an Story Corporation said.
