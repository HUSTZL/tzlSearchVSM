Birds enjoy 'frozen dessert' in NE China
After the freezing rain, the temperature has dropped drastically in Harbin, northeast China's Heilongjiang Province. The cold weather has wrapped the red fruits of the rowan trees in crystal ice, transforming them into nature's version of the tempting sugar frosting on traditional Chinese winter snack, bingtanghulu. Although humans delight in the crispy sugar-coated hawthorn on a stick every winter, one can only guess whether the Bohemian waxwings, Naumann's thrushes and other migratory songbirds in the area for the winter are happy about the extra work it might take to get to the rowan fruits that comprise their usual seasonal feast.
