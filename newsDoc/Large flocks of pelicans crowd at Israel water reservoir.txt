Large flocks of pelicans crowd at Israel water reservoir
Pictures taken on November 8 show white pelicans at a water reservoir in Emek Hefer Valley, north of Tel Aviv, Israel. Pelicans stop over in Israel during their annual migration from the Balkans to Africa, where they enjoy a mild winter before returning to Europe. They rest and feed for weeks, causing chaos for fish farmers, whose outdoor commercial pools and reservoirs provide rich pickings. Farmers have tried to deter them with loudspeakers, laser beams and by firing blank rounds from rifles. In their desperation, they have come up with another way: offering the birds a free lunch.
