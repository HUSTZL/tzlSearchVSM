Bharal seen in Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, SW China
On November 14, a photographer encountered a group of bharal running around in the wild in Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in southwest China's Sichuan Province. These bharal are not afraid of strangers. Some are running, while more are overlooking from the mountain slope.

Bharals are under second-class national protection in China. They are also called Chinese blue sheep for the color of their fleeces. In the rocky mountain terrain of southwest China, this kind of camouflage is great protection against predators. The number of bharal in the area has been rising recently due to continuous conservation efforts.
