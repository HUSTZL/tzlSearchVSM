Tsai's shameless opportunism will be brought to an end
Editor's note: CGTN's First Voice provides instant commentary on breaking stories. The daily column clarifies emerging issues and better defines the news agenda, offering a Chinese perspective on the latest global events.

In an interview with CNN on Wednesday, Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) leader Tsai Ing-wen confirmed U.S. troops are present in the Taiwan region, saying she had "faith" in America's willingness to defend the island.

It comes amid a tidal wave of provocations that separatists are using to push the agenda of so-called Taiwan independence. This included trips to Central and Eastern Europe, as well as bids to meet members of the European Parliament. They are making all-guns-blazing efforts to challenge the bottom line of the Chinese mainland.

The separatists are pursuing a strategy of "provocation diplomacy" ¨C a tactic designed to garnish as much sympathy as possible from the West, provoking a reaction from the mainland and then subsequently playing the victim.

It is a tactic also used in the attempt to undermine China's wider relationships with various countries by urging them to push against their commitment to the one-China principle. In doing so, the DPP aims to create more political space for its cause, hoping every time when it moves the needle, the U.S. will support it and prevent the mainland from fighting back.

However, Tsai's shameless and reprehensible opportunism will soon be brought firmly to an end and those instigating Taiwan separatism will pay a price.

China is willing to do whatever it takes to defend its national sovereignty and territorial integrity, with the goal of an inevitable and irreversible reunification between Taiwan and the mainland. It is prepared to undergo costs to do so. This goal is non-negotiable, and China's bottom line is not bluff to be ignored or dismissed.
