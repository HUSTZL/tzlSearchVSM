People in India are waiting in very long lines to get their dose of the COVID-19 vaccine COVISHIELD.

Officials are checking identification papers and giving tokens to get the shot.

With wait times extending into the night, some are sleeping outside the vaccination centers to save their spot in line.

The COVISHIELD is manufactured by the Serum Institute of India.
