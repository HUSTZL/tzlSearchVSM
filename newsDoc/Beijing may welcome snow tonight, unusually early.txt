Beijing may welcome snow tonight, unusually early
As a cold wave hits and temperatures drop, Beijing may usher in winter snow unusually early tonight.

Rain has begun to fall in the Chinese capital, and the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) predicts it will turn to snow during the night and into Sunday morning.

CMA data since 1961 shows that the first snowfall generally takes place in late November. The earliest first snow date was October 31 (1987), and the latest was on February 11 (1984).

In recent years, there has been a trend of warming and humidification in northern China, and abundant water vapor may be one of the reasons for the early snowfall in Beijing and the increase in rain and snow, according to China Environment News.
