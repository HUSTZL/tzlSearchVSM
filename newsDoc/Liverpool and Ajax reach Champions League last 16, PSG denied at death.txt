Liverpool and Ajax kept up their perfect records in the Champions League this season to qualify for the last 16 on Wednesday, while a Paris Saint-Germain side missing Lionel Messi were held by RB Leipzig.

Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool blew Atletico Madrid away in a whirlwind start at Anfield, with Diogo Jota and Sadio Mane scoring in the first 21 minutes to secure a 2-0 win against opponents who finished with 10 men.

Atletico's Brazilian defender Felipe was sent off for a foul on Mane before half-time, as the 2019 Champions League winners made it four wins out of four in Group B.

Liverpool are now guaranteed to top the group, sitting seven points clear of Porto with two games remaining, while Atletico are another point back in third.

Porto drew 1-1 away to AC Milan, as Chancel Mbemba's own goal at San Siro canceled out Luis Diaz's early opener for the Portuguese side.

It was a first point in the group for seven-time former European champions Milan, who maintain a slim chance of reaching the knockout phase in their first appearance in the competition since 2013-14.
