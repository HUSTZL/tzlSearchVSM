India's Pushkar camel fair returns
India's famous Pushkar camel fair is back. Hundreds of herders and their camels gathered in the desert city to show off and trade their camels. The 13-day fair typically has competitions and other events involving the herders and their camels. But it's unclear whether all activities will resume during the fair because of COVID-19.
