Panicked Kabul residents gather around airport trying to flee
On August 16, Afghan residents gathered around Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul after the Taliban took control of the capital. They were trying anxiously to enter the airport and flee Kabul. A local man followed his younger brother to the airport to encourage him to return home. However, he could not find his brother. "Those who came from foreign countries, they destroyed our country, and left us alone. They have left with all our property," he said.
