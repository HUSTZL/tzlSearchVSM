The pandemic raises childcare costs
American middle class families are struggling to pay for child care and its increasing costs.

COVID-19 disrupted the formal child care industry.

Many Daycare centers have closed and those providers still serving their communities have raised their fees to cover new safety measures -while competing for the few teachers willing to work.

Meanwhile, parents scratch their heads wondering how can they afford it.

We begin our series The Child Care Crisis with CGTN¡¯s Nitza Soledad Perez, who explores the costs of child care for parents in Miami, Florida.
