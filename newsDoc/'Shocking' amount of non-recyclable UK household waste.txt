'Shocking' amount of non-recyclable UK household waste
In this section of CGTN's #ZeroWasteChallenge, we asked our four volunteers from four continents to examine their waste production at home. This is what we discovered.

"I've never thought about how much it costs to throw things away," admits our #ZeroWasteChallenge volunteer Francesca Della Penna, an Italian living in London, before some quick calculations reveal that residents on her street pay the council almost $150,000 a year in rubbish removal.

"The problem is that there is no incentive for me regarding waste 每 if I throw one bag of rubbish away it costs me the same as if I throw three bags away," she says. "This is the problem at the heart of richer countries regarding waste 每 out of sight, out of mind."

Della Penna then fearlessly takes us through her rubbish for the week, attempting to ascertain precisely which parts are recyclable in her area 每 it differs between local councils.

It also gives her a chance to check her food usage: "I try not to waste too many of the vegetables I buy 每 I haven't been producing a lot of food waste, which I'm proud of because I'm on a challenge here!"
