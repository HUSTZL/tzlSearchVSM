'Profits before people' at Facebook, whistleblower tells EU Parliament
03:05

The whistleblower responsible for leaking the so-called "Facebook Files" has told the European Parliament in Brussels that the social media platform puts "immense profits before people." "I believe Facebook's products harm children, stoke division, weaken our democracy and much more," said Frances Haugen during a hearing of the Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee. She also told lawmakers they have a "once in a generation opportunity to align the future of technology and democracy." The European Parliament is currently working on new legislation to regulate social media platforms.

The former Facebook employee leaked thousands of internal documents earlier this year, accusing the company of prioritizing "growth over safety." She has already testified before the U.S. Congress, the UK Parliament and is set to meet French lawmakers in Paris on Wednesday. Her former employer, which recently rebranded its parent company as Meta, says Haugen is using the documents to create a "false picture" of its business culture. Haugen was testifying in Brussels as European lawmakers work on new legislation aimed at making tech giants such as Facebook and Twitter more transparent. She also met with European Commissioner for the Internal Market Thierry Breton. "Europe is serious about regulating what still resembles a digital Wild West," said Breton on Twitter, alongside a photograph of him and Haugen.
