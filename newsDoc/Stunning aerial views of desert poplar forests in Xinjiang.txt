Stunning aerial views of desert poplar forests in Xinjiang
Don't miss this stunning autumn view! The populus euphratica forests in Yuli County, northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region turned gold, contrasting beautifully with the blue skies above the Gobi area in October.

The reflections of the glamorous forests could be seen along the clear Tarim River.

The populus euphratica, commonly known as desert poplar or euphrates poplar, is a magical species that can survive in extremely dry and cold areas. In China, the desert poplar are considered to be able to "live for a thousand years, then stand for a thousand years after death, then stay imperishable for another thousand years."
