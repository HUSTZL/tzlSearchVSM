Mausoleum of China's first emperor reopens after COVID-19 shutdown
The mausoleum of the first Chinese emperor Qinshihuang reopened in northwest China's Shaanxi Province on Friday after doors were shut in July because of a COVID-19 outbreak. The Emperor Qinshihuang's Mausoleum Site Museum will operate at a 30 percent capacity to control visitor flow after resuming operations, and tourists need to make online reservations in advance. Group tours are not allowed in for the time being. One of the city's landmarks, the facility consists of the Terracotta Army Museum and Qinshihuang Mausoleum Ruins Park, spanning a remarkable area of 56.25 square kilometers, equivalent to 78 of Beijing's Palace Museums.

Discovered in 1974, the army of Terracotta Warriors was built by Emperor Qinshihuang of the Qin Dynasty (221 B.C.-207 B.C.), who is credited with unifying China.
