'Bomb cyclone' dumps rain across California
A 'bomb cyclone' is dumping record amounts of rain on California. While the rain will help fight wildfires in the north, officials warn after several large fires and drought, the ground is unstable and susceptible to flash flooding and mudslides.

Hundreds of thousands were without power during the peak of the storm. Officials say the storm will continue to dump rain across the state throughout the day.
