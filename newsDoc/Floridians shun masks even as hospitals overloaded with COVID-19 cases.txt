Florida has seen a surge in COVID-19 cases in recent weeks due to the highly transmissible Delta variant, which has led to a major increase in state hospitalizations. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, between August 1 and 9, a daily average of 54 children under 18 were admitted to hospital with COVID-19. A stringer hit the streets of Miami and found that many people there still don't wear masks. He spoke to a doctor, Carlos Torres Viera, about the current situation in the Sunshine State.
