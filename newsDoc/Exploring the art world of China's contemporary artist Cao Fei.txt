Exploring the art world of China's contemporary artist Cao Fei
In the world of contemporary art, Cao Fei from China is a name not to be missed. The artist has gained wide recognition across the globe over the past two decades through documenting the changes and developments of China's society, using photography and film.

She also uses digital media in innovative ways to highlight her fascination with the virtual and futuristic worlds, utopia and dystopia. Recently she shared her career and inspiration with CGTN, explaining how pop culture has influenced her art direction.

Many of her works explore different groups of people. For example, her "HX" project is about workers in the past. She is also interested in subculture and youth culture.

She adds that her interest has much to do with the city of Guangzhou, where she was born. Guangzhou is a city at the forefront of China's reform and opening up. It was exposed to the impact of foreign culture very early in the 1980s, Cao said.

At that time, foreign culture, technology and products have influenced people's daily life. From her earliest works, people can see her interest in pop culture. Electrical appliances were especially popular in southern China at that time, including videotapes, VCRs and the earliest karaoke sound systems.
