The art and antiquities section of the 4th China International Import Expo (CIIE) yielded fruitful results on opening day.

Procurement intent involving seven artworks with a combined value of over 140 million yuan (about $21.9 million) was reached on Friday, according to the Shanghai Administration of Culture and Tourism.

They are from six exhibitors including Sotheby's, Christie's and HENI, a UK-based international art institution.

Sotheby's is presenting a selection of masterworks by artists including Claude Monet, Marc Chagall, Alberto Giacometti, Yayoi Kusama and Zhang Daqian. The works serve as outstanding examples of each artist's oeuvre, spanning decades and traversing continents.
