The U.S. 'sincerity' on Afghanistan aid
In something of a contradiction, the U.S. has pledged humanitarian aid to Afghanistan while freezing more than $10 billion in overseas asset earmarked for the country's reconstruction. As Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian has pointed out, this hypocrisy is akin to cutting off the water supply while handing your neighbor just a bottle of water to extinguish a blaze that is destroying the home.
