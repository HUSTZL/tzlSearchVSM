Former Raiders coach Jon Gruden sues NFL for his lost job
Jon Gruden, former head coach of the NFL's Las Vegas Raiders, is suing the league and its commissioner, Rodger Goodell, for forcing him to leave the position.

The lawsuit was filed on Thursday in the Eighth Judicial District Court in Clark County, Nevada, according to Gruden's attorney, Adam Hosmer-Henner.

"The complaint alleges that the defendants selectively leaked Gruden's private correspondence to the Wall Street Journal and New York Times in order to harm Gruden's reputation and force him out of his job," Hosmer-Henner said in a statement. "There is no explanation or justification for why Gruden's emails were the only ones made public out of the 650,000 emails collected in the NFL's investigation of the Washington Football Team or for why the emails were held for months before being released in the middle of the Raiders' season."

The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times first reported in October about emails by Gruden that used racist, anti-gay and misogynistic language, amid an NFL investigation into claims of workplace misconduct against the Washington Football Team.
