RNA molecules of COVID-19 discovered in Italy from before the pandemic
A landmark study in Italy has found molecular evidence of COVID-19 circulating as early as mid-September 2019, five months before the country's first official clinical diagnosis.

Researchers from Milan University retested samples from patients with "measles-like" symptoms and found ribonucleic acid (RNA) from the virus in one patient dating back to September 12, 2019.

Emanuele Montomoli is the professor of public health at Siena University and Scientific Director of the VesMederi laboratory. He said the latest study gives concrete and direct evidence of Italy's COVID-19 timeline.

"The most important thing is that they're looking for the real virus and the Milan group found RNA of the virus, so this is the real demonstration," said Montomoli.

Research by VesMederi has also played a key role in determining traces of the virus in Italy's pre-pandemic period.

In collaboration with the Milan Cancer Institute, its researchers retrospectively tested 1,000 blood samples from a lung cancer screening trial and found antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 dating back to late September 2019.

"We received congratulations from the World Health Organization and they asked us, considering the importance of our results, to repeat the analysis in another independent lab," said Montomoli.
