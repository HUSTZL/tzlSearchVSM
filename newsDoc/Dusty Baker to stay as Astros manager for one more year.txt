Dusty Baker to stay as Astros manager for one more year
The Houston Astros have extended the contract of Dusty Baker as their manager by a year after the World Series loss against the Atlanta Braves, announced the team on Friday.

"He's done a great job this last year. Great in the locker room, great with the fans, great with the media. We're very, very excited to have him back," Astros owner Jim Crane said.

Baker took over the team in 2019 from AJ Hinch who was fired after the MLB-shocking sign-stealing scandal investigation. Baker took the team to the American League Championship Series in his first season before losing to the Tampa Bay Rays 4-3.

One year later, the Astros went further in the playoffs and played six games with the Braves in the World Series.

"Looking forward to being part of this organization and this city," Baker said. "Some guys are interested in coming here that might not have been interested in coming here before, so I think our future is very bright."
