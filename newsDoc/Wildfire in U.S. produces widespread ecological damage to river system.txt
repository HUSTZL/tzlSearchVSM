Wildfire in U.S. produces widespread ecological damage to river system
One year after the most destructive wildfire in U.S. Colorado history torched 845.4 square kilometers, biologists were lamenting the slow recovery of the nearby water system.

"As feared, recent surveys of the river showed thousands of fish were killed as a result of the fire and its lasting impact," CBS 4 Denver reported Saturday.

"The runoff events we shot this summer, post fire, have had a detrimental impact on the fishery," aquatic biologist Kyle Battige said.

The survey was conducted one year after the Cameron Peak Fire, the Centennial State's worst fire on record, by Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW). It also engulfed some 461 structures, consumed millions of dollars of resources and took thousands of fire fighters to contain.

Despite widespread drought conditions throughout west U.S., Colorado has seen significant precipitation this fall, and "since the rain on the burn scar caused flooding in the Poudre Canyon in July of this year," that resulted in several deaths, wildlife officers with CPW have been monitoring "the detrimental impact the blaze had on fish in the Poudre River," CBS reported.

A flash flood swept through the canyon on July 26, where three people died and one was missing after being swept away by flooding and mudslides, according to the website of the Colorado Public Radio.

Battige surveyed the burn-scarred region and river drainage in July, one day after the deadly flash flood, and told Kiowa County Press, "a loss of fish has been observed and we will continue to monitor the situation."

Senior CPW aquatic biologist Jeff Spohn also said, "we will hold off on fish population impact comments until we can collect standardize data."

The results of this week's survey were called "shocking" by CBS 4.
