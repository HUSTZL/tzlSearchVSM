History will not remember traitors in a good light
Editor's note: CGTN's First Voice provides instant commentary on breaking stories. The daily column clarifies emerging issues and better defines the news agenda, offering a Chinese perspective on the latest global events.

Separatists in the Taiwan region believe that conflict with the Chinese mainland would work in their favor. They have been doing their best to use the current tension between the United States and China to extract a solid military commitment from Washington.

So far, President Joe Biden is offering strong, but vague language suggesting the U.S. is willing to use force to prevent the reunification of the Taiwan region with Chinese mainland ¡ª even as his administration denies the comments. The U.S., it seems, wants to draw the Chinese government into a battle with its own people in order to undermine China's unity at home and credibility abroad.

The U.S. is primarily interested in weakening China and slowing its rise. Like Taiwan's separatist leaders, the last thing the U.S. cares about is the safety, well-being or future prosperity of the people living on the island of Taiwan. The people living on the island are pawns in America's larger power games, as the U.S. desperately tries to retain global hegemony and control the rules of the world economy.

China, however, will not be easily manipulated into a shooting war that would surely defeat Taiwan separatists, but could be spun to give the appearance that China is subjugating its own people. China has many options to deal with internal division. Military action is far from China's only tool to deal with separatists who seek to betray the motherland and split the country.
