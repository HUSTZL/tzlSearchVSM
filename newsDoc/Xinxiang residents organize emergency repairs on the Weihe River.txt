On the afternoon of July 23, CGTN Global Stringer filmed an overflowing embankment near the Weihe River in Xinxiang City, Henan Province. A cordon was set up around the seepage area, and Xinxiang residents organized emergency repairs, reinforcing the river bank with steel plates and pipes, and erecting sandbags to prevent the leakage gap. According to estimates by on-site personnel, the water level of the river is 2-3 meters higher than usual.
