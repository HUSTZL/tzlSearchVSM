The Toronto Blue Jays reached a seven-year, $131 million contract extension with right-handed pitcher Jose Berrios, according to ESPN.

It will be the first $100 million deal signed during the MLB offseason if Berrios passes his physical exam.

The Blue Jays landed Berrios from the Minnesota Twins right before the trade deadline last season by sending 2020 fifth-overall selection Austin Martin and 2018 second-rounder Simeon Woods Richardson to the Twins. Both Martin and Richardson were on the MLB Top 100 Prospects list.

Berrios had a 12-9 record in 2021 with an earned run average (ERA) of 3.52 and 204 strikeouts. His starting record in 12 games was 5-4 with a 3.58 ERA. He missed being an All-Star again after last making the team in 2019.
