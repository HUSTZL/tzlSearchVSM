Relics of drainage pipe, road and rut remains have been found in the ruins of Haojing, an ancient capital city dating back to the Western Zhou Dynasty (1046-771 BC), in today's Xi'an, northwest China's Shaanxi Province, according to the provincial academy of archaeology.

The drainage pipe was uncovered in the foundation of the No. 14 building on its central-south edge, which was excavated between 2019 and 2020, the institute said on Wednesday.

Over three meters long, the pipe ruins are made of four round earthenware pipes with a diameter of about 25 centimeters, providing physical materials for further studies on the drainage system of the ancient construction.
