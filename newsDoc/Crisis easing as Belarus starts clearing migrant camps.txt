Crisis easing as Belarus starts clearing migrant camps
Authorities in Belarus have started to clear the main camps where migrants have huddled at the border with Poland. Many of the migrants have been moved to a giant warehouse, providing shelter from the freezing temperatures. It's seen as an attempt by Belarus to ease tensions with Poland and the European Union. But the European Commission and Germany still reject Belarus's proposal that EU countries take in 2,000 migrants currently on its territory.
