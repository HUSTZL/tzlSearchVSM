Newly-elected International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) Vice President Aivaz Omorkanov is in the Chinese capital for the Olympic test events which consists of four teams from Beijing.

He voiced hopes that Beijing 2022 Olympic Winter Games would promote the sport in China as the "Experience Beijing" test event for ice hockey opened earlier this week with fewer than 100 days to go until the Beijing Games.

Omorkanov, who was a former national ice hockey player in Kyrgyzstan, was elected as regional vice-president Asia and Oceania in September 2021. At the age of 25, he is the IIHF's youngest ever council member.

"The main purpose of the test event is to check the venues, to build good environment, to build good conditions for the players, for the game officials, for the staff, so the Winter Olympic Games will be in perfect condition," said Omorkanov on Tuesday at the Wukesong Sports Center, which will host the Olympic ice hockey tournament in February.

"We can clearly see that in general everything is good, but there are some small areas that need to be improved."

"I studied in Beijing for almost seven years and I love China, I love Chinese people, I love Chinese culture and I'm so happy to be back," said Omorkanov, who majored international economics and trade at the Beijing University of International Business and Economics.

"I hope that we will use the chance to promote the ice hockey game in China."
