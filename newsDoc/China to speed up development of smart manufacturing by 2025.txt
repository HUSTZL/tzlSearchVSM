China is to carry out a series of pilot projects to accelerate the development of smart manufacturing during the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025), according to a joint statement (link in Chinese) by four government departments on Thursday.

China carried out 305 pilot projects for smart manufacturing during the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020), the statement said, and the government will promote the smart and comprehensive transformation of the manufacturing industry in the next five years.
