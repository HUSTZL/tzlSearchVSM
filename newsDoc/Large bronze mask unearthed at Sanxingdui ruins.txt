A large bronze mask was discovered from pit No. 3 of the Sanxingdui ruins in southwest China's Sichuan Province on Thursday, it's relatively well preserved, and more complete than other relics discovered so far in the ruins.

"It can be regarded as the largest bronze mask unearthed in Sanxingdui, and possibly the largest in the Shang (1600-1100 B.C.) and the Zhou dynasties (1100-221 B.C.)," according to archaeologist Xu Feihong, who is the person-in-charge of the archaeological work in Sanxingdui's No.3 ritual pit.

"The widest part, from one tip of the ear to the other, is 136 centimeters and the height is roughly 75 centimeters," said Xu. It was unearthed from the central part of the No.3 pit, the mask is with complicated burial conditions.

Since six more pits were found in March, the widely anticipated archaeological excavation of the Sanxingdui Ruins site has been proceeding, yielding approximately 10,000 cultural relics dating back over 3,000 years, according to the Sichuan Provincial Cultural Relics and Archaeology Research Institute.
