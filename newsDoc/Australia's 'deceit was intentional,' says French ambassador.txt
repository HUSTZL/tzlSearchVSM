Australia's 'deceit was intentional,' says French ambassador
In September, Australia pulled out of the deal with France's Naval Group in favor of the so-called AUKUS alliance, which provides it with 12 nuclear-powered submarines using U.S. technology.

"The deceit was intentional. And because there was far more at stake than providing submarines, because it was a common agreement on sovereignty, sealed with the transmission of highly classified data, the way it was handled was plainly a stab in the back," Jean-Pierre Thebault said, while speaking to the media in Canberra.

France's ambassador to Australia has claimed Canberra intentionally deceived Paris when it pulled out of a multi-billion-dollar submarine deal in favor of an alternative one with the U.S. and the UK.

The incident caused a major rift and France withdrew its ambassadors to both the U.S. and Australia. And, although they have returned, there is still tension between Paris and Canberra.

On Sunday, France's President Emmanuel Macron said Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison lied to him before pulling out of the deal. Morrison denied the allegation and said he had previously told Macron that France's submarines would not meet his country's needs.

The relationship was further tested when a text message Macron sent Morrison before Canberra pulled out of the deal was leaked to the Australian media.

"Should I expect good or bad news for our joint submarine ambitions?" Macron's message read.

The European Union has entered the fray and has postponed free trade talks with Australia since the incident. But despite this, the relationship between the U.S. and France seems to be on a better footing.

U.S. President Joe Biden said the handling of the pact was clumsy and that he was "under the impression" more had been done to update France before the AUKUS alliance was announced.
