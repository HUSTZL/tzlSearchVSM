New Zealand qualified for the ICC Men's T20 World Cup final after beating England by five wickets at the Sheikh Zayed stadium in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday.

New Zealand chased down 167 as Daryl Mitchell starred with 25 off his last seven deliveries which saw the Black Caps win the encounter with an over to spare.

England had earlier posted 166 for four with Moeen Ali hitting an unbeaten 51 after New Zealand captain Kane Williamson had won the toss and elected to bowl.

England captain Eoin Morgan conceded that he would have bowled first had he won the toss as the pitches in the United Arab Emirates have favoured the team chasing.

Defeat means England missed out on a third-straight place in a World Cup final.

New Zealand will now face either Australia or Pakistan in Sunday's final.
