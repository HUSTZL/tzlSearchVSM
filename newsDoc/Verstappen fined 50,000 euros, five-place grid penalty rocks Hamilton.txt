F1 stewards fined Red Bull's championship leader Max Verstappen 50,000 euros ($57,250) on Saturday after he touched and examined the rear wing of title rival Lewis Hamilton's Mercedes following Sao Paulo Grand Prix qualifying.

The 24-year-old Dutchman, who leads seven-time world champion Hamilton by 19 points with four races left, qualified second for Saturday's 100 kilometers sprint race that determined the starting grid for Sunday's event at Brazil's Interlagos.

After the session on Friday, Verstappen inspected the rear wing elements on his car and Hamilton's Mercedes, touching them with his hands.

Later that afternoon the governing International Automobile Federation (FIA) revealed that Hamilton's car had failed a technical inspection by a matter of millimeters.

The Briton risked being sent to the back of the grid or forced to start in the pitlane for the sprint race. He also already has a five-place grid penalty for Sunday's grand prix due to an engine change.

The stewards said in a statement that Verstappen had breached article 2.5.1 of the international sporting code. The article covers behavior in the secure "parc ferme" area after qualifying.

It stipulates that no unauthorized "operation, checking, tuning or repair is allowed".
