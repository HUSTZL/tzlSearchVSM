Uncle Sam's duplicity on Taiwan
Recently, the U.S. government has been hyping the Taiwan question and Secretary of State Antony Blinken delivered a speech in support of Taiwan joining the UN system. On multiple occasions, the U.S.'s actions have been found to be contrary to the one-China policy, which it says it adheres to. The U.S. is patently duplicitous!
