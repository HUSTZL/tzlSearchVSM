Three people have been injured in a knife attack on a high-speed train in Bavaria in Germany, local police said. "According to preliminary information, several people were injured," police in Neumarkt in der Oberpfalz said in a statement, adding that the alleged perpetrator had been arrested and "there is now no more danger."

There was no evidence that other attackers are at large, the police spokesman said. The ICE high-speed train was traveling between Regensburg and Nuremberg when the attack happened at about 9 a.m. local time. The train is now in the station of Seubersdorf in the country's south, with a large police operation at the site.

Officers said a 27-year-old man was in custody. The motive for the attack on the passenger train, making its way from Bavaria to the northern city of Hamburg with roughly 300 people on board, is not yet clear. Local prosecutors are handling the case rather than the federal officials who would deal with suspected terrorism. The three victims were being treated in hospital, said police statement said, adding that none had suffered life-threatening injuries.
