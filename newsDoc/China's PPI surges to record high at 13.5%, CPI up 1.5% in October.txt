China's factory-gate inflation hit a 26-year high in October, while consumer prices rose slightly amid public concern over food shortages, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Wednesday. The country's official producer price index (PPI), which reflects the prices factories charge wholesalers for their products, rose by 13.5 percent in October from a year earlier, hitting the highest level since July 1995.

PPI growth in October was 2.8 percentage points higher than that in September, and above 12.3 percent predicted by Bloomberg and 12.4 percent by Reuters. "In October, due to the imported international factors and tight domestic supply of major energy and raw materials, the increase in PPI expanded," said Dong Lijuan, a senior statistician with the NBS. The jump in October was fueled by a 103.7-percent year-on-year surge in the coal mining sector, up from an increase of 74.9 percent in September, according to Dong. NBS data on Wednesday also showed that China's consumer price index (CPI), a major gauge of inflation, went up by 1.5 percent in October from a year ago, up from 0.7 percent in September.
