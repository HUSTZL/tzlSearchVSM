Weak measures against the pandemic made Louisiana lose its vigor
Louisiana has one of the lowest COVID-19 vaccination rates in the U.S. and is one of the epicenters of the current outbreak. In New Orleans, Louisiana, some hospitals have had to switch other units to COVID-19 wards, and doctors are filling in as nurses. In the nearly two years since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, the U.S. government has taken a number of measures to prevent the disease, but the recent outbreak is still severe.
