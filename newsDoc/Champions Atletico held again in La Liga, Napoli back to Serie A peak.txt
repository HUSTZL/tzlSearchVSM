Atletico Madrid spurned the chance to move level on points with Real Madrid on Thursday after conceding two penalties, the second in the 89th minute, to draw 2-2 away at Levante.

Atletico led twice at the City of Valencia Stadium as Antoine Griezmann opened the scoring before Matheus Cunha's first goal for the club looked to have sealed victory.

But each time Levante, who sit second bottom in the La Liga table, hit back from the spot after first a Luis Suarez foul and then a late handball by Renan Lodi allowed Enis Bardhi to convert from 12 yards.

"The reality is that we have to improve and quickly," said Atletico coach Diego Simeone, who was also sent off towards the end of the contest after being given a second yellow card for dissent.

Atletico edged up to fifth place, five points off leaders Real Sociedad, who earlier returned to the top of the table with a 2-0 away win at Celta Vigo.

Goals from Alexander Isak and Aritz Elustondo in the second half were enough for La Real, who have not lost since going down 4-2 to Barcelona on the opening day of the season.
