Significant amounts of methane are leaking from landfill sites in Madrid. High-resolution Global Emissions Monitoring satellites (GHGSat) recorded the spike in methane being emitted from two facilities close to the city center.

Using data from Copernicus Sentinel-5P mission combined with the satellite imagery, scientists from the SRON Netherlands Institute for Space Research first recorded the leak on August 20. With follow-up observations on October 13, the largest leak of methane was emitting the greenhouse gas at a rate of approximately 5,000kg per hour.

Satellite imagery indicates the methane cloud will drift over nearby houses unless the leak is stopped.

The cause of the emissions is unknown, although the initial findings came days after Madrid recorded its highest ever temperature (40.72 degrees Celsius).

The 1999 Landfill Directive requires European Union landfill operators to capture gas created by the decomposition of organic material and to either use it for energy generation or burn it off through flaring.
