India prepares for Diwali
Shoppers across India are buying up idols, lamps, and other colorful wares as they gear up for Diwali, the festival of lights. Devotees decorate their homes with lamps worshipping Lord Rama and celebrate by setting off firecrackers with family and friends.

Diwali is typically celebrated all over India commemorating the return of Hindu Lord Rama to Ayodhya in northern India after defeating Ravana, the powerful demon king of Lanka.
