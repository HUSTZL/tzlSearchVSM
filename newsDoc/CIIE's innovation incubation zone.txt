CIIE's innovation incubation zone

The organizers of the China International Import Expo (CIIE) in Shanghai are really creative in that they have brought new meaning to the term "import expo."

An import expo is already something rarely heard of outside of China, as I have yet to find another country on planet Earth that is so stubbornly bent on increasing imports. But China, which enjoys such a large trade surplus that it encourages trade partners to sell more products, is one such country.

Yesterday came the October trade figure ¨C $84.5 billion ¨C which shows a surplus increasing at a breakneck pace. To put things in perspective, a country able to export $84.5 billion a year would make it the world's 44th largest exporting country, ahead of Greece, Chile, Argentina, and etc. But here we are talking about China's only one-month trade surplus, meaning exports minus imports. At this pace, we are going to see another year of half-a-trillion-dollar trade surplus for 2021.

The CIIE is not only helping foreign companies to sell in China but helping them to succeed in China, especially small and micro companies. It is doing so by organizing "innovation incubation zones" ¨C exhibition areas for companies to showcase products that are still at the very early stage of commercial operation.

What it means is that the CIIE would like to help these carefully selected small and micro companies succeed in China before they become international players, by getting their probably yet-to-mature products exposed to the market and perhaps more importantly exposed to investors.
