The Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) on Wednesday voiced China's strong opposition to a recent U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ban on China Telecom's U.S. subsidiary.

The FCC voted to revoke China Telecom Americas' license providing telecommunication service in the United States, citing national security concerns, a week ago.

China Telecom Americas has been operating in the U.S. for nearly 20 years, abiding by U.S. laws, regulations and regulatory requirements and providing high-quality services to many customers in the U.S. in accordance with commercial principles, the MIIT said.

The MIIT said the move was based on subjective speculation and suspicion without listing the specific facts of violations of the law by the company.

"This does not conform to the image of a market-oriented country of the U.S. and has also harmed legitimate rights and interests of global consumers," it said.

The ministry urged the U.S. to stop generalizing the "national security" concept and cracking down on Chinese companies without factual justification, adding that China will continue to take all necessary measures to protect the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies.
