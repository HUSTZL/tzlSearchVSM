President Xi's pledge to open the wallet is good news for many

At the opening ceremony of the 4th China International Import Expo (CIIE), President Xi Jinping delivered a keynote speech via video. The speech, as expected, emphasizes China's resolve to continue to open up its market for trade and investment. In Xi's words, "Going forward, China will lay more emphasis on expanding imports and pursue balanced development of trade."

China's trade performance is indeed a dazzling success, probably the envy of many countries in the world. Last year trade in goods surplus was $534.8 billion, mitigated by a deficit in service trade of $145.3 billion. So the overall trade surplus reached $388.5 billion. That is a lot of money, contributing immensely to China's over $3 trillion in foreign exchange reserves.

The trade performance of the first three quarters of this year shows a continuous upward trend, as both exports and imports increased by about 23 percent, with a surplus of $277 billion. That is trade in goods though. If, again, the trade in goods is mitigated by the deficit in trade in services, my projection is that the whole year would see a current account balance smaller than last year's, but still perhaps around $300 billion.

That kind of trade surplus is not going to be sustainable over the long run, both economically and politically. So President Xi's publicly announced policy of "balanced development of trade" should be good news for many. The CIIE event itself is the ultimate proof that the Chinese government is indeed striving to work in the direction of balanced trade in earnest. No country in the world hosts a trade exhibition event of this scale that is exclusively dedicated to increasing imports.
