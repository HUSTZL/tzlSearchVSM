The third China Archaeological Congress opened on Monday in the city of Sanmenxia, central China's Henan Province as the country celebrated the centennial of the establishment of modern Chinese archaeology.

China's National Cultural Heritage Administration (NCHA) unveiled the country's top 100 archaeological discoveries in the past 100 years during the opening ceremony.

Covering 29 provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, as well as the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the Taiwan region, these archaeological sites are divided into eight categories based on the historical periods in which they originated, spanning from the Paleolithic period to the Ming and Qing dynasties (1368-1911). Thirty-three of them, the largest in number, fall under the category of the Neolithic period.

Henan Province is home to the largest number of archaeological sites listed, 14 in total, followed by Shaanxi Province in northwestern China, which has 11.

Some of the familiar names such as Zhoukoudian, Liangzhu and Sanxingdui have made it onto the list.
