'Be Somebody' crowned as China's 2021 box office total tops $6.8 bln
Black comedy "Be Somebody" seems to have greatly amused Chinese moviegoers, taking the top slot at China's box office in the past week (November 8-14) with more than 139.4 million yuan ($21.9 million), according to box office tracking platform Maoyan.

The crime movie, directed and co-written by Liu Xunzimo, concerns a group of frustrated filmmakers who gather to make a new film about a notorious criminal case without realizing that the killer is among them.

Starring a strong ensemble of veterans and rising comedians such as Yu Entai and Yin Zheng, it premiered on November 11 and had raked in 166.2 million yuan as of Tuesday.

Coming in second with about 55.7 million yuan in ticket sales was "No Time To Die," Daniel Craig's last James Bond movie. Since opening on October 29, the 007 adventure has garnered a cumulative gross, or cume, of 373.4 million yuan in China.

In third spot was domestic war epic "The Battle at Lake Changjin," having pocketed a further 51.2 million yuan in its seventh week of screening, bringing its cume up to 5.64 billion yuan to become this year's highest grosser worldwide so far.
