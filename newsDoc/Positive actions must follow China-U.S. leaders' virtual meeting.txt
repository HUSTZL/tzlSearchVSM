Positive actions must follow China-U.S. leaders' virtual meeting

On November 16, Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Joe Biden engaged in a virtual meeting, the first since Biden took office. The meeting saw the two leaders discuss strategic and fundamental issues.

During the meeting, Xi told Biden that the two countries "should respect each other, coexist in peace, and pursue win-win cooperation" and that a "sound and steady" relationship is crucial "for advancing the two countries' respective development and for safeguarding a peaceful and stable international environment" not least in addressing "global challenges such as climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic."

It's time to act on that message. The United States needs to manage its relationship with China ¨C the most important and crucial bilateral diplomatic relationship in the world¨C with maturity, pragmatism and reason, as opposed to being driven by trigger-happy, impulsive, fear-inducing and dangerous posturing that have brought ties to the brink. Instead of trying to change or challenge China, Washington must strive to work with it in pursuit of the best results, recognizing in turn this relationship is not a zero-sum game.

Over the past several years, American foreign policy towards China has been stuck in a rut of selfishness, small-mindedness and reactionary politics floated on nostalgia and an inability to accept change. In other words, the rise of China has created an identity crisis in the U.S., which has led it to become obsessed with a power-hungry dream of sustaining global dominance at all costs, bringing about counterproductive, self-destructive and irrational behavior, hyping up the China threat.
