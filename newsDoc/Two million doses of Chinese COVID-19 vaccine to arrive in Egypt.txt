Two million doses of Chinese COVID-19 vaccine to arrive in Egypt
Two million doses of Chinese coronavirus vaccines are expected to arrive in Egypt "very soon," Chinese ambassador to Egypt Liao Liqiang said during an online press briefing on Wednesday, according to Ahram Online.

Egypt has already purchased 10 million Chinese vaccine doses and is expected to purchase more than 100 million doses by the end of this year, according to Liao.

Egyptian vaccine producer VACSERA has also signed an agreement to manufacture Sinovac vaccines under the name Sinovac/VACSERA for local use and for export to African countries.

Egypt has been using China's Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines for its mass vaccination campaign.

Bilateral relations between the two countries have reached a new level since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, with Egypt and China supporting each other, Liao noted.

According to Ahram Online, Egypt has inoculated about 24 million people against COVID-19. The government expects 40 million people to complete the vaccination by the end of this year.
