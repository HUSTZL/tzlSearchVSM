La Palma island braces for more quakes as volcano roars on
Residents on Spain¡¯s La Palma island braced on Wednesday, the possibility of bigger earthquakes that could compound the damage from a volcano spilling lava for more than five weeks since it erupted.

Seismologists said a 4.6-magnitude earthquake shook the island a day after they recorded a 4.9-magnitude quake that was the strongest so far of the hundreds that have occurred underground La Palma since the volcano¡¯s September 19 eruption.

So far, the earthquakes have either been small enough or far enough under La Palma to do no harm, other than adding to the anxiety of the island residents. The Tuesday earthquake was felt up to 96 kilometers away from the island on three other segments of the Canary Islands, an archipelago off northwest Africa.

¡°The scientific committee has been warning for more than a week that we could see earthquakes, given their recent depth of around 12 kilometers and their magnitude, that reach a magnitude of 6,¡± said Mar¨ªa Jos¨¦ Blanco, director of Spain¡¯s National Geographic Institute on the Canary Islands.
