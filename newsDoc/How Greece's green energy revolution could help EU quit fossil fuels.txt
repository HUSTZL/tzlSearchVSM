How Greece's green energy revolution could help EU quit fossil fuels
Wind turbines in Greece set a national record on September 6, accounting for 81 percent of the country's electricity output.

High temperatures, wildfires and flooding pretty much sum up the weather patterns in Greece since the summer.

From an unprecedented amount of rain in Evia, to the fires that ravaged hundreds of thousands of hectares of land in Ancient Olympia. Scientists blame it on climate change.

But Greece is fighting back ¨C pushing for a transition to clean energy and carbon neutrality by producing renewables at record levels.

"September 6 was a day of records for the Greek renewable sector: 81 percent of the total clean energy in the country was provided by wind and 60 percent of the total energy consumed was offered by clean renewable energy sources," said Ioannis Margaris, vice-chairman of Independent Power Transmission Operator (IPTO), Greece's power-transmission system.
