European countries take measures to fight new COVID-19 wave
Several European countries are imposing measures to fight a new round of COVID-19 infections. From Thursday, Ireland will require bars and nightclubs to close early, and it will ramp up the use of booster vaccines. In Slovakia, the government is planning measures to limit access to services for unvaccinated people, as hospitals are getting overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients.
