The 2004 sinking of a French fishing boat in UK waters, with the deaths of five people, was an accident, a British coroner has ruled, rejecting claims it was dragged down by a submarine.

The Bugaled Breizh sank off Cornwall, southwest England, in good weather nearly 18 years ago.

Lawyers for the French victims' families argued that a submarine on exercises could have become tangled with the boat's nets and pulled it down.

But, after an inquest with weeks of evidence at London's High Court, Judge Nigel Lickley ruled: "The Bugaled Breizh sank ... as a result of a fishing accident.

"The probable cause was that the vessel's fishing trawl gear became buried and snagged in the seabed, which, in the relevant area, comprised of a layer of sediment and mud.

"It is likely that this soft snag led to the progressive loss of stability of the vessel, which ultimately caused the Bugaled Breizh to sink.

"There was no other vessel involved in the sinking, whether submarine or surface vessel."
