Beijing's Brazilian steakhouse still hot after over two decades
Churrasco, or Brazilian grill, has had a large fanbase in China ever since the 1990s.

In east Beijing's embassy area Sanlitun, Brazilian steakhouse Latina is always packed during mealtimes. Chef Dinomar Drabach, from Brazil, has been grilling meat in different countries for over 30 years.

After working in the United States, Japan, South Korea and Europe, the chef settled down in the Chinese capital 20 years ago.

"I come here at eight or nine o'clock every day. I prepare the meat and check everything in this restaurant," he said. "People come here and keep coming back next week."
