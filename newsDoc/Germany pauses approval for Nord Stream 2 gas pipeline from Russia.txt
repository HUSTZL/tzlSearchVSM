Germany pauses approval for Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia
Germany's energy regulator has suspended the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which would channel Russian gas directly to the heart of Europe.

The Bundesnetzagentur said it could not consider the application until certain conditions had been fulfilled, including the creation of an entity under German law.

The pipeline has faced opposition from the U.S. and some European states, which say it will make Europe too reliant on Russian gas. In addition, it would bypass Ukraine, denying revenue and weakening the country geopolitically at a time of accentuated tensions with Moscow.
