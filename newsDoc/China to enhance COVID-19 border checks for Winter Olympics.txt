China to enhance COVID-19 border checks for Winter Olympics
China's National Immigration Administration (NIA) will strengthen COVID-19 prevention measures for people entering and leaving the country on account of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.

Immigration authorities have been asked to set up special areas for checks on personnel relevant to the Winter Olympics at entry and exit points and implement strict anti-epidemic measures.

Stressing continuing strict entry and exit policies, the NIA encouraged people to avoid unnecessary and non-urgent travel abroad.

It also vowed to cooperate with law enforcement authorities of neighboring countries in border patrols to crack down on criminal activities and prevent the spread of the virus.
