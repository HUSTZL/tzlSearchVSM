Pandemic fuels RV boom in China
It's just another day for the Lis who have lost count of the times they've been on the road. So far the family from Beijing have traveled 90,000 kilometers by RV, across 31 provinces and regions, and 32 countries.

The Lis recreational vehicle has a living room area with a sofa, a kitchen and a bathroom. There is a vertical bed as well as one perched above the driver's seat.

The self-sufficiency and freedom offered by the RV travel lifestyle increasingly appeal to Chinese travelers.

"Because of the pandemic, we can't go anywhere. Recreational vehicles give us the freedom to go anywhere," explained Fan Lina, an RV traveler. "We don't need to worry about booking hotels or getting up late. It gives us a lot of flexibility and saves a lot of money."

Last year, there were 27 million internet searches for RV travel on Chinese websites, 48 percent more than in 2019. The sales of recreational vehicles hit another record, almost 70,000 units last year.
