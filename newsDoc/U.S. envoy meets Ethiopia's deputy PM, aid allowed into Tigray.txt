U.S. envoy meets Ethiopia's deputy PM, aid allowed into Tigray
A U.S. special envoy has met with the Ethiopian deputy prime minister to try to restore peace talks. Jeffrey Feltman and his African Union counterpart Olusegun Obasanjo landed in Ethiopia on Thursday. Also, the Ethiopian government has allowed over 360 aid trucks to enter the Tigray region in the north. It's at the center of the conflict and is suffering from famine. The UN says some 70 aid workers arrested last week have all been released.
