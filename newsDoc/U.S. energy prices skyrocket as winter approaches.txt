U.S. energy prices skyrocket as winter approaches
Winter is coming and it¡¯s shaping up to be an expensive one.

The price of oil and natural gas - the most common ways Americans heat their homes - is skyrocketing.

At this point, things aren¡¯t quite as bad as they are in Europe and Asia, where gas prices are trading nearly six times higher. The price difference is stoking demand from abroad, which could drive prices even higher at home.
