CGTN talks with burgeoning playwright and theater director Wang Haoran
Since the beginning of the 21st century, Chinese theater has produced a new crop of talents. With the majority of these artists being born after 1978, and growing up during China's economic boom, the New Generation's work tends to be more individualistic and experimental. Among these burgeoning talents is award-winning playwright and director Wang Haoran.

Wang is a burgeoning talent in Chinese theater. His stage works are known for reflecting upon social reality, while blending poignant observations with a sense of humor ¨C which he developed during his childhood.

Wang's first play "Blast" was commissioned and produced by the Hong Kong Arts Festival in 2013. Set in a 400-square-foot apartment in an unnamed city, the story tells the tale of three roommates who get into an absurd debate regarding bathroom etiquette. With a keen sense of humor, Wang looks at how rapid urbanization has exacerbated alienation in confined urban living spaces.

"Blast" is full of swearing, said Wang.

"Some audience can't endure my play. Some audience quite loved my play," Wang shared with CGTN. "But the ticket was sold out for that. Most audience think it's quite interesting."
