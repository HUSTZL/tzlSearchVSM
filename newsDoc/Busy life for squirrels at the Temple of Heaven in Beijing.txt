Busy life for squirrels at the Temple of Heaven in Beijing
It's autumn again! The best season for squirrels to bustle around and store plenty of nuts for the coming winter.

At the Temple of Heaven in Beijing, the Eurasian red squirrels and Pallas's squirrels are a common sight. They are not afraid of people and simply focus on their own work ¨C to eat and store food, and sometimes "steal" others' collections.

Eurasian red squirrels are big fans of nuts, and they are adept at peeling them. If one stands under the tree where they are eating, one will experience a rain of fruit peels.
