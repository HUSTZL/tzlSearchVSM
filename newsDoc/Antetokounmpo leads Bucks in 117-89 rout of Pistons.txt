Giannis Antetokounmpo had 28 points, nine assists and eight rebounds as the Milwaukee Bucks ended a three-game losing streak with a 117-89 rout of the Detroit Pistons on Tuesday.

With Brook Lopez (back) sidelined, Antetokounmpo spent much of the time playing center on defense. He blocked four shots but did not want to stay at the new spot.

The Bucks also got 16 points from Pat Connaughton and reserve Jordan Nwora.

"We really needed this one tonight," Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. "We talked about setting the tone on both ends of the floor, and I thought we did that. Obviously, Giannis was a big part of that, but we saw a lot of other guys stepping up," he added.

Jerami Grant led the Pistons (1-6) with 21 points, but Trey Lyles was the only other player to reach double figures with 13.

"We know this is all part of the growing pains that a young team has to deal with," Grant said. "That doesn't make it any easier to go through what we're going through. We need to get focused tomorrow, because we've got a back-to-back coming up against pretty good teams."
