Lewis Hamilton was fined for undoing his seal belts after he sealed a sensational victory starting from 10th on the grid in the F1 Brazilian Grand Prix in Sao Paulo on Sunday.

After crossing the line, the Mercedes driver undid his belts to grab a Brazilian national flag from a marshal before setting off again on his victory lap.

According to the stewards' verdict, it was a 5,000 euros (about $5,700) fine for Hamilton with an additional 20,000 euros (about $22,850), which is suspended through the end of 2022, F1.com reported.

The ruling said, "The driver of car 44, Lewis Hamilton, undid his seat belts on the in-lap at the end of the race."

"While the Stewards are sympathetic to the desire to celebrate, it is fundamentally unsafe to undo the seat belts while the car is in motion. Slow speeds in these cars are very fast for an unrestrained occupant."

"Further, Formula 1 drivers set the example for junior categories. It is critical that junior category drivers learn the importance of using all the safety devices of the car at all times."
