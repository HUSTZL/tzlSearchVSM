CIIE facilitates global access to huge Chinese market
The on-going 4th China International Import Expo (CIIE) is helping boost other countries exports to the Chinese market, at a time when the world is still struggling to fight COVID-19 pandemic and gain stream in the economic recovery.

Thailand, whose pillar sector tourism has tumbled after almost two years of the pandemic, sees its exports to China a bright spot amid the economic gloom.

Thailand exports to China rose by 33.2 percent in the first nine months of this year, led by shipments of agricultural products, which surged by a whopping 56.3 percent year on year, according to China's General Administration of Customs.

The upcoming launch of a high-speed railway in Laos and the planned construction of a high-speed railway in Thailand will fast track transportation of Thailand's exports, especially farm produce, to the dining table of Chinese consumers.
