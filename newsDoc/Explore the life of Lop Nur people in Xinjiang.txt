Explore the life of Lop Nur people in Xinjiang
Lop Nur People Village is located in Yuli County, northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, where Tarim River flows through the deserts with poplar forests' reflection on the shimmering waves.

The roots of Lop Nur people can be traced back thousands of years. As one of the oldest groups to live in the Taklamakan Desert, they depended basically on fishing for their livelihood and developed a distinct culture based on their unique lifestyle.

Nowadays, most of Lop Nur people have various options for their lives, but there are still a few of them who stick to the traditions of fishing and making canoes out of populus euphratica trees.

Lop Nur People Village is now a popular tourist spot in Xinjiang's Yuli County and attracts a number of visitors every year.
