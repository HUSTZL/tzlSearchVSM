China's 'star' jet trainer L-15 appears at Dubai Airshow 2021
China's locally-built jet trainer L-15, dubbed by the media as a "star model," appeared at the Dubai Airshow 2021 which began on Sunday.

The L-15 is a two-seat, twin-engine supersonic model designed to satisfy the need of training the best pilots.

"The model is for export purposes," military expert Wang Mingliang told China Media Group (CMG). "Its performance is on-par with third-generation fighters."

Wang added that the jet is equipped with weapons enabling to serve as a real fighter when necessary.

Many media outlets in China are showing a picture of an L-15 taxing beside a F-16 fighter from the U.S. to imply the tension between the two countries. But Wang said they are thinking too much and there's nothing to worry about the airshow.
