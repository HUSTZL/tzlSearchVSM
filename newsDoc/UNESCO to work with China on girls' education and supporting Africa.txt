UNESCO to work with China on girls' education and supporting Africa
Audrey Azoulay, the director-general of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has told CGTN it works closely with China on promoting education for girls and supporting applications for African sites to gain heritage status.

Following her successful re-election, the former French culture minister aims to improve freedom of the press and the safety of journalists and continues to work closely with China, which contributes 15 percent of the UNESCO budget after the U.S. and Israel left in 2017.

Ross Cullen, CGTN correspondent: How has UNESCO dealt with the challenge of education during a pandemic?

Audrey Azoulay: We went through something unprecedented, something extraordinary. At the peak of the pandemic, there were 1.5 billion children who could not go to school. So the terrible question for us was: how to ensure the continuity of education without schools?

Education is a right, and when schools are closed, there is a big risk of a loss of learning, affecting pupils' health, in fact a risk for all of society. And so UNESCO has worked to support distance-learning in the countries for which that has been the hardest.

RC: You have been re-elected as director-general of UNESCO. What will you do differently in this new term in office?

AA: Well for me, myself, I am a different person from when I started here. Four years at UNESCO makes you rub up against the world in a very diversified way, so I have learnt a lot from my visits, my meetings, so I was able to learn during these past four years.
