Ed Sheeran has COVID-19, will do performances from home
British pop star Ed Sheeran said Sunday he has tested positive for COVID-19 and will do interviews and performances during self-isolation at home.



Sheeran, 30, broke the news on social media days before his new studio album is due out.



"Quick note to tell you that I've sadly tested positive for Covid, so I'm now self-isolating and following government guidelines," Sheeran wrote on Instagram. "It means that I'm now unable to plough ahead with any in person commitments for now, so I'll be doing as many of my planned interviews/performances I can from my house. Apologies to anyone I've let down."



Sheeran had just been announced as the musical guest on NBC's "Saturday Night Live" on November 6.
