UK and France fail to agree an end to post-Brexit fishing dispute
The UK and France have failed to agree an end to their ongoing dispute over fishing.

The two sides say negotiations related to licenses and access to UK and EU waters for trawlers will continue next week.

It follows talks on Thursday in Paris between the UK Brexit Minister David Frost and Clement Beaune, France's Europe minister.

The statement from the UK read: "Lord Frost and Europe Minister Clement Beaune met in Paris this morning.

"As foreshadowed, they discussed the range of difficulties arising from the application of the agreements between the UK and the EU. Both sides set out their positions and concerns.

"Lord Frost and minister Beaune expect to speak again early next week."

At the start of the week, France threatened to impose sanctions on British boats, including potentially barring them from landing their catch in French ports.

France's President Emmanuel Macron then suspended the possible new restrictions, saying that dialogue must be given a chance.

The wider post-Brexit dialogue will continue on Friday when Frost travels to Brussels to meet European Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic.

The two men will discuss the problems related to the Northern Ireland Protocol, as well as fishing.
