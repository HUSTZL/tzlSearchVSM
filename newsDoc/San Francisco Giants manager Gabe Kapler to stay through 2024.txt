San Francisco Giants manager Gabe Kapler to stay through 2024
The San Francisco Giants of the MLB announced on Friday that they've extended the contract of their manager Gabe Kapler by another two years until 2024.

Kapler just finished his second season in the Giants in 2021, during which he led them to 107 wins, the best in the National League (NL) West and franchise history. As a result, the defending champions Los Angeles Dodgers, which won 106 games, had to begin their postseason from the Wild Card Game against the St. Louis Cardinals.

But the Dodgers got their revenge by beating the Giants 3-2 in the following NL Division Series.

Kapler took over the Giants in 2019 when his predecessor Bruce Bochy retired. Kapler reshuffled the managing staff before the team finished the shortened 2020 regular season with a 29-31 record, which was very close to playoff qualification.
