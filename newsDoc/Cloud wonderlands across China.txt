Cloud wonderlands across China
Looking down from the Longqi Mountains in east China's Fujian Province, the clouds look like surging waves. The view from the Lijiang River in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is shrouded in clouds and mist. When it comes to Fenjiezhou Island in south China's Hainan Province, cloud after cloud can't hide the blue sky while the Qiantang River in east China's Zhejiang Province is grey with clouds covering the sun.
