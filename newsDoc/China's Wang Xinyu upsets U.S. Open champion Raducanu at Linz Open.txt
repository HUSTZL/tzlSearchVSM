China's Wang Xinyu upsets U.S. Open champion Raducanu at Linz Open
Chinese tennis player Wang Xinyu pulled off the biggest upset of the Linz Open in Austria on Tuesday, outlasting No. 1 seed and U.S. Open champion Emma Raducanu 6-1, 6-7(0), 7-5, in the second round.

"I really felt the passion here," the 20-year-old Chinese player from Shenzhen said after her triumph. "It's also my first time here. I really enjoy playing this tournament."

The defeat brought the curtain down on Raducanu's breakthrough season, during which she won her maiden Grand Slam, at Flushing Meadows in September.

Wang got off to a blistering start and clinched the opener in just under half an hour as her deep returns forced the top seed into a number of errors. Raducanu was unable to match her opponent, who won over 85 percent of points on her first serve.
