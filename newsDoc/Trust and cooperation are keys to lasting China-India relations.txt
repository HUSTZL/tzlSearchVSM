Trust and cooperation are keys to lasting China-India relations

On November 11, Indian Chief of Defense Staff Bipin Rawat claimed at a summit held by India's Times Now TV station that "China is our greatest enemy today, not Pakistan." Although since the conflict between China and India in the Galwan Valley, the top leaders of the People's Liberation Army and the Indian Army have held nine military commander-level talks to seek a peaceful bilateral solution on the issue, some peace breakers are eager to instigate separation, hinder the process of Sino-Indian cooperation, and exacerbate tensions in the Indian Ocean and the Himalayas.

Unleashing hostility is not an act of mutual trust

Trust is the result of joint efforts of both sides, not ideological hegemony of either side. However, recent hostile media remarks by Rawat are clearly a groundless attempt to accuse China of acting in bad faith.

Rawat said, at the meeting, that there is a lack of "trust" and growing "suspicion" between the two sides in resolving the border dispute. But, on the other hand, India wants to unite with the U.S. to control China's activities in the Indian Ocean and the Himalayas and prepare for war at any time.

Such a logical paradox exposes India's compensatory response after losing its dominant position in South Asia and its ambition to expand its territory in this region continuously.

India's strategy towards China under the effect of high self-esteem alienation

Bipin Rawat is a typical representative of India's "high self-esteem" centralized personality. "High self-esteem" emphasizes that some individuals attach great importance to their dignity and will be potentially aggressive when their self-esteem or interests are threatened or rejected.
