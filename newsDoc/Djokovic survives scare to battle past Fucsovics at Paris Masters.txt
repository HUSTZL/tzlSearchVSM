World number one Novak Djokovic from Serbia endured a tough return to the ATP singles circuit but battled through to beat Marton Fucsovics of Hungary 6-2, 4-6, 6-3 in the second round of the Paris Masters on Tuesday.

The 34-year-old 20-time Grand Slam champion had said on Sunday his greatest fear was lack of match practice having not played since Daniil Medvedev dashed his dreams of a Grand Slam sweep in the US Open final in September.

The Serbian's fears were borne out as Fucsovics put up a sterner test than the 'rabbit caught in the headlights' one he had produced when they met in the Wimbledon quarter-finals earlier this year.

Djokovic barely had to engage second gear when cruising to the first set in 38 minutes with the loss of just two games.

But Fucsovics broke early to go 3-1 up in the second, energizing the evening crowd at Bercy.
