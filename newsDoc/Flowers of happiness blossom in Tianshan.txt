Flowers of happiness blossom in Tianshan
Fears surrounding COVID-19 cannot dampen the spirit of artists. Musicians from Xinjiang Traditional Orchestra perform their representative repertoire in the form of an online ensemble.

Named "Flowers of happiness blossom in Tianshan," this piece of Uygur folk music describes the joy of people living at the foot of the Tianshan Mountains who got rid of poverty and became prosperous, living happily like radiant flowers under the shining sun.
