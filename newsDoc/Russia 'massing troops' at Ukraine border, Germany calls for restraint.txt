Russia 'massing troops' at Ukraine border, Germany calls for restraint
NATO and Germany have warned Moscow not to escalate the situation on the Ukraine-Russia border after reports of the Russian army massing troops and equipment in the area.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg noted "large and unusual concentrations of Russian forces," and instructed Moscow's government to "prevent escalation and reduce tensions."

He added NATO is "monitoring this situation very closely."

"Any further provocation or aggressive actions by Russia would be of serious concern. We call on Russia to be transparent about its military activities," former Norway Prime Minister Stoltenberg said.

On Monday, Germany's Foreign Minister Heiko Maas urged Moscow to exercise "restraint" at the Ukraine border.
