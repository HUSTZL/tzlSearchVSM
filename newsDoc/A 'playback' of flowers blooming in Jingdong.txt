A 'playback' of flowers blooming in Jingdong
Plants often give the impression of being immobile, but that's because we don't watch them long enough. In fact, they dance in the wind and bloom in the sunshine. This video, using 3D technology, reproduces the fleeting blooming of seven flowers in Jingdong Yi Autonomous County.

Jingdong County, near Pu'er City in southwest China's Yunnan Province, has two national nature reserves ¨C the Ailao Mountain and Wuliang Mountain national nature reserves. The complex terrain and diverse climate there have created great plant diversity. The county has thus been hailed as a "Demonstration County of International Biodiversity Project."
