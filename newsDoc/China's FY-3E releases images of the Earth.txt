China's FY-3E releases images of the Earth
This batch of Earth photos were captured by the Fengyun-3E (FY-3E) weather satellite and released Thursday, showing how the Blue Planet looks in the moments of dawn and dusk ¡ª the most volatile moments in terms of terrestrial radiation and among the most susceptible moments to extreme weather events. It's the FY-3E weather satellite's third batch of photos released.

Dawn and dusk are the periods of the day when the Earth's radiation changes most rapidly, leading to disastrous weather. FY-3E provides high-resolution observations of the globe in low-light conditions such as dawn, dusk and moonlight at night. Also, it provides cloud, the Earth's surface, sea surface structural features, which helps improve the ability to monitor and forecast severe weather, according to Zhang Peng, deputy director of the National Satellite Meteorological Center (NSMC), told a news conference Thursday at China Meteorological Administration in Beijing.
