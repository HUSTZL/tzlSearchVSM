Russia confirmed it would deploy a new paratroop regiment to Crimea by December after complaining about a British agreement to boost Ukraine's navy. It said it showed British military activities were expanding near its borders.

Russia's military said it would establish the new regiment on the peninsula, completing a reshuffle of forces signaled by Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu in March, the Interfax news agency reported.

At the same time, Moscow voiced its objections to a framework agreement under which Ukraine will use British financing to enhance its naval capabilities, allowing it to buy missiles and build ships and a navy base on the Sea of Azov.

"We see this fact as the latest practical evidence of increasing British military activity in the states bordering Russia, in particular Ukraine," Russia's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told a weekly briefing.
