Duterte to run for Senate, not against daughter ¨C aide
Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte will compete for a senate seat in the 2022 elections. It ends speculation that he would run for vice president against his own daughter, Sara Duterte, who will be running alongside Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Activists have denounced the alliance, with protests held outside the Commission of Human Rights office in Manila. They say the Marcos-Duterte pair is the biggest threat to the democratic aspirations of the Philippine people.
