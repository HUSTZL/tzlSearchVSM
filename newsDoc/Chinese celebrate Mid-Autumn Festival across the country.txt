Chinese celebrate Mid-Autumn Festival across the country
The annual Mid-Autumn Festival falls on September 21 this year. This traditional festival originated from the Zhou Dynasty (1045-221 BC) and has been celebrated since the early Tang Dynasty (618-907).

The Chinese believe the moon is at its brightest and fullest size during the festival. Lanterns of varying shapes and sizes are displayed at night, and family members reunite to appreciate the moon and enjoy moon cakes.
