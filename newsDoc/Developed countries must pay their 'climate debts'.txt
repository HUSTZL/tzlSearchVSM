Developed countries must pay their 'climate debts'
Editor's note: CGTN's First Voice provides instant commentary on breaking stories. The daily column clarifies emerging issues and better defines the news agenda, offering a Chinese perspective on the latest global events. Over the weekend, nearly 200 participating countries at COP26 adopted the Glasgow Climate Pact. The pact sought to double down on the commitments sealed previously in the Paris Climate Accords and to phase down the global use of coal. While heralded as a win, some people proceeded to criticize the agreement as an unsatisfactory compromise. In doing so, many international news outlets sought to offload blame on developing countries such as China and India, as watering down the agreement through their reliance upon the commodity for growth, accusing them of watering the statement from "phase out" to "phase down." As one example, the Financial Times ran with: "COP26 agrees new climate rules but India and China weaken coal pledge." In seeking to shovel the blame of climate obligations purely onto developing countries, who sit at an enormous energy disadvantage, the West is not only disregarding their own emissions per capita but likewise downplaying their more historically entrenched "climate debt" in being the first and longest lasting industrial countries. It is wrong, despite all the efforts China is undertaking which otherwise receive very little recognition, to say Beijing is somehow negligent or disruptive to what is a global challenge. If the developed countries are not satisfied with what the developing countries are capable of, they must be prepared to put their money where their mouths are and invest more.

There's a common responsibility for every country to work together in tackling climate change. But it doesn't mean that every country has exactly the same playbook or shoulders the same burden. Developing nations need to develop. China and India, for example, both have over 1 billion people each and are rapidly growing economies which require ever growing amounts of energy. In pursuing growth, their rise in carbon emissions is a recent phenomenon which only became significant in the latter half of the past century. For China in particular, this goes back little more than 40 years or so. In contrast, the United Kingdom, just to name one, was the first industrialized country in history, and began large-scale carbon emissions as early as the first half of the 19th century. From 1750 to 1850, Britain's cumulative CO2 emissions amounted to 3.7 billion tonnes, climbing to 77.8 billion tonnes by 2019, according to Our World in Data. With China's industrialization being modern, which country has been more detrimental to global climate change? Britain has arguably been the largest driver of it comparatively in human history. Contemporary China may be of course a lot larger. Yet, in China's own resolve to dramatically invest in solar, hydroelectric, wind and nuclear power, it is true to say it will never have the historically laden "climate debt" of which Britain has spanning centuries. Yet as a fully developed country, the UK does not need an enormous growth in electricity annually either. Despite this, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said after the pact that "my delight at this progress is tinged with disappointment."
