China aims to get 56 percent of the country on 5G networks by the end of the 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-2025), up from 15 percent in 2020, according to a plan released by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) on Tuesday.

So far, China has built over 1.15 million 5G base stations, which account for more than 70 percent of the world's total, said Xie Cun, head of the Information and Communication Development Department of the MIIT.

It's the world's largest and most advanced standalone 5G network, covering all prefecture-level cities, more than 97 percent of counties and 40 percent of towns, he said.

The number of 5G terminal users in the country has reached 450 million, accounting for more than 80 percent of the world's total, he said.
