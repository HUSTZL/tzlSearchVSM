Colorful water pools shimmer in SW China's autumn sun
On September 28, 2021, the Huanglong Scenic and Historic Interest Area in Songpan County of southwest China's Sichuan Province welcomed a sunny autumn day. As a UNESCO World Heritage site, it is known for its magnificent colorful water pools. These water pools are made of travertine, a form of limestone often deposited in hot springs. The water displays different colors based on the elements and algae in the water, as well as light absorption and reflection.
