Injured people are arriving at Kabul hospitals after two blasts outside Hamid Karzai International Airport.

The exact numbers of people who died or are injured is unclear.

A couple of hours before the bombs exploded, officials warned of a security threat by the airport.

Early reports indicated at least one of the explosions was caused by a suicide bomber, according to a U.S. military official, the New York Times reports.
