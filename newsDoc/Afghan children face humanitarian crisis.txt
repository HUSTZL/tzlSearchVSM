About 10 million children in Afghanistan need humanitarian assistance to survive, according to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).

UNICEF warns that 4.2 million of children are out of school. Some 435,000 kids are internally displaced. The UN has recorded more than 2,000 violations of children's rights since January.

A severe drought, water shortages, COVID-19, the oncoming winter and now the Taliban are all factors impacting the humanitarian needs of people in Afghanistan.

UNICEF expects the humanitarian crisis to get worse.

The organization says it will stay in Afghanistan in the days to come.

According to the World Food Programme (WFP), one-third of the country's population is facing food insecurity.

They're asking for $200 million by the end of the year, so they can keep working in Afghanistan after the Taliban's takeover.

Without this funding, WFP Executive Director David Beasley says the program will start to run out of food in September, reports Al Jazeera.

Beasley adds, the Taliban has assured the WFP can continue to provide aid to Afghanistan.

"So far they [the Taliban] have calibrated, cooperated and given us the access we need," he told Al Jazeera.
