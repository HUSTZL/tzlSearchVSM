Europe 'could face more than half a million COVID-19-related deaths'
A strong warning about rising COVID-19 deaths has come from the World Health Organization (WHO) as infections hit record levels in many countries, with 1.8 million new infections in one week.

Germany recorded 37,120 new coronavirus cases on Friday, the second consecutive day of record daily infections.

Slovakia reported 6,713 new cases, also a record, while daily new cases in Hungary more than doubled from last week to 6,804 on Friday.

Poland, Eastern Europe's biggest economy, reported 15,515 daily cases on Thursday, the highest figure since April. Croatia and Slovenia on Thursday both reported record daily infections.

In the 53 countries classed as the Europe Region, the figures for last week show a 6 percent increase in new cases, with 1.8 million new infections and a 12 percent increase in COVID-19-related deaths.

"The current pace of transmission across the 53 countries of the European Region is of grave concern," regional WHO head Hans Kluge said, adding that the spread was exacerbated by the more transmissible Delta variant.
