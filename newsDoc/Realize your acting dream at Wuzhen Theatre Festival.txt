Realize your acting dream at Wuzhen Theatre Festival
Since October 15, the entire water town of Wuzhen, called by some as China's Venice, has been transformed into a stage for performance artists to showcase their talent. Here, the streets and canals come alive with the sights of carnival, and drama is everywhere to be found. You might even bump into a famous director or actor at a local noodle stand.
