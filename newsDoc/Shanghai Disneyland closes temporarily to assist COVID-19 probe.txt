Shanghai Disneyland closes temporarily to assist COVID-19 probe
Shanghai Disneyland and Disneytown will be closed on Monday and Tuesday "in order to follow the requirement of COVID-19 prevention and control," the resort announced on Sunday night.

"We will notify guests as soon as we have a confirmed date to resume operations," it noted.

All visitors still inside the resort when the notice was announced will have to undergo nucleic acid testing before leaving and have a second test 24 hours later from the first one, the resort said earlier in a statement.

A resident from Jiangxi Province tested positive for COVID-19 in Hangzhou City on Sunday afternoon reported her trip to the Disneyland on Saturday, several Chinese media reported.

Over the past few days, various activities and parties to celebrate the Halloween have been held there.

Shanghai municipality's COVID-19 control and prevention office has also issued an emergency notice on Sunday, asking all visitors who have been to the Disneyland and Disneytown over the weekend to report to their communities, companies or schools, and immediately go to their nearest designated medical institutions for nucleic acid testing.

China has seen a COVID-19 resurgence since mid-October. As of Saturday, fresh local infections have been reported in 14 provinces across the country, the National Health Commission (NHC) said at a press briefing on Saturday afternoon, adding that the latest wave is developing quite fast.

Also on Saturday, China's top epidemiologist Zhong Nanshan said the country will contain the latest flare-ups within a month. He added that more than 80 percent of the Chinese residents will be fully vaccinated by the end of this year.

As of Friday, a total of 2.26 billion vaccine jabs had been administered in China, with over 1.07 billion people out of the 1.4 billion population fully inoculated, according to data from the NHC.
