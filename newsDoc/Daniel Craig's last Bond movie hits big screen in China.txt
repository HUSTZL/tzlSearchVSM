Daniel Craig's last Bond movie hits big screen in China
China's domestic box office saw revenues of 594 million yuan ($92 million) in the last week of October, a further drop linked to a resurgence of COVID-19, data from the box office tracker Maoyan showed. "The Battle at Lake Changjin," a historical epic paying tribute to Chinese soldiers martyred in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea (1950-1953), maintained its position as the top-grossing movie, earning 197 million yuan. Its box office takings totaled 5.5 billion yuan after 31 days of screening, making it the world's highest-grossing title so far this year. The Chinese production was followed closely by the latest James Bond film, "No Time to Die," which took in 180 million yuan in the first three days of its release in China. It has been leading the daily box office chart in the country since its debut on October 29.
