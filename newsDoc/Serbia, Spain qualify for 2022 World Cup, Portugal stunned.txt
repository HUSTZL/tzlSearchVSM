Serbia, Spain qualify for 2022 World Cup, Portugal stunned
Cristiano Ronaldo looked dejected sitting on the floor after Portugal were stunned by Serbia 2-1 in the last minute in the 2022 World Cup qualifier match on Sunday.

Serbia directly qualified for the World Cup after this victory, while Ronaldo and his teammates will have to play two one-off playoff matches in March next year to fight for the last chance to qualify and sustain their record of participation in every major tournament since the 1998 World Cup.

Renato Sanches opened the scoring for Portugal only two minutes after the game started. Serbia, however, quickly adjusted themselves and dominated the remainder of the first half and equalized the match in the 33rd minute with a goal from Dusan Tadic. Serbia's Aleksandar Mitrovic seized the chance to score right before the stoppage time and sealed the deal at 2-1.
