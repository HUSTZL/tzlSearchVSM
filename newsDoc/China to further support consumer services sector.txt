China to further support consumer services sector
China on Tuesday issued guidelines to further support the country's services sector, aiming to improve people's quality of life in many aspects.

China's consumer services industry has developed vigorously in recent years, but there are also issues like insufficient supply, low quality standards, talent shortage and inadequate policy implementation, said the State Council.

The country will strengthen basic public services in the fields of urban and rural education, public health, basic medical care, culture and sports, and expand the supply of inclusive life services with guaranteed quality and affordable prices, said a notice on the website of the State Council.

It will establish service standards and brand quality, and make trials in the areas of elderly care, childcare, housekeeping, and property services, with enterprises as the main body.

On the financial side, the country will increase tax and investment support, actively use relending and rediscount tools to support agriculture-related fields, small and micro enterprises, and private enterprises, said the note.

Local authorities should also establish an emergency mechanism to cope with a major disease outbreak, disaster or accident, and introduce necessary measures to help services firms, according to the note.
