Meet some lovely animals from SW China's Yunnan
Kunming, the capital city of southwest China's Yunnan Province is to host COP15, the UN biodiversity conference, from October 11 to 15.

Yunnan has all types of ecosystems, except ocean and desert. The number of species of each genus either approaches or exceeds half of the national total, even though the province has only 4.1 percent of China's total land area.
