China celebrates 100th anniversary of modern archaeology
An event marking the 100th anniversary of the birth of modern Chinese archaeology was held on Sunday in the city of Sanmenxia, central China's Henan Province.

The discovery of the Yangshao Culture (5000-3000 BC), a Neolithic culture derived from the middle reaches of the Yellow River and mainly found in today's Henan and Gansu provinces, is seen as the beginning of the country's modern archaeology.

A hundred years ago, a small village named Yangshao in Henan's Mianchi County was discovered, leading to excavation work and archaeological findings, hence the name of the ancient civilization.
