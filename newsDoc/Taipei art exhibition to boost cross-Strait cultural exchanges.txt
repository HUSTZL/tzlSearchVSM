Taipei art exhibition to boost cross-Strait cultural exchanges
An exhibition of paintings and calligraphy by artists from both sides of the Taiwan Straits opened on Saturday in Taipei to promote cultural exchanges.

About 250 painting and calligraphy pieces by 200 artists from across the Straits are on display at the exhibition, according to Chang Lien-hsing, the exhibition's organizer.

"This exhibition shows the achievements and characteristics of contemporary painting and calligraphy art both on the mainland and Taiwan," said Ting Chin-chuan, an artist participating in the exhibition.

"It's conducive to closer cultural exchanges between the artistic circles across the Straits and passing on the fine traditional Chinese culture," Ting added.

The exhibition will last until November 21 in Taipei.
