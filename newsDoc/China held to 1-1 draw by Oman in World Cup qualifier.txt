China was held to a 1-1 draw by Oman in their Asian FIFA World Cup qualifier at Sharjah Stadium in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates, on Thursday.

Espanyol midfielder Wu Lei put China ahead shortly before the midway point in the first half, a lead they held until the 75th minute when Amjad Al Harthi levelled for Oman.

The result leaves China in fifth place in Group B with four points, three behind fourth-placed Oman. The two sides are set to meet again on March 29.

China's next group game, however, is against Australia on Tuesday while Oman faces Japan on the same day.
