Munich cancels Christmas market as COVID-19 infections hit annual high
"Good morning," I say as I approach a stall owner carefully peeling off gold paper lining from the walls of his wooden hut.

"What's good about it?!" he snarls back. His response embodies the mood in Munich's Christkindlmarkt or "Christ Child Market" early Wednesday morning.

On Tuesday afternoon, the city's Mayor Dieter Reiter canceled the public markets in the city for the second year in a row, saying it would be irresponsible for the event to go ahead, considering the record COVID- 19 infection numbers.

Delicate balance

Many of the stall owners understand the delicate balance required to operate such a public event while the city's hospitals are filling up with COVID-19 patients, but many are angry over the timing of the announcement.

"The cancelation should have come a little earlier," Anika Gisinger tells CGTN. Gisinger and her son own one of the Christmas stalls in Munich's popular Marienplatz. While they had not completed setting up the stall, their neighbor, Helmut Berger, had been eagerly anticipating the market's opening on November 22.

"Last Monday, I was told that I was allowed to set up," Berger said, confirming the city's original decision to go ahead with the market.

"And in the end, the result is that we are standing here having to dismantle now. We have to bear all the costs. For example, the electrician, the commercial costs and so on, and immediately. Nobody pays our costs."

When asked if they will receive compensation from the city, both Gisinger and Berger said they are unsure. "We do not know that yet. They said yes, but we'll have to wait and see," said Gisinger.
