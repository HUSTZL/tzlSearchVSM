Indians plant trees in park made of uncollected human ashes
Bhadbhada Crematorium in Bhopal, central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, is using uncollected ashes of those who died in the second wave of COVID-19 to plant trees. CGTN's stringer visited this "human ashes park," and met two families planting trees. They said their family members had died from COVID-19 and they cremated the bodies there. They said people could not only memorialize their loved ones in this way, but also help protect the environment, as local rivers and streams don't end up getting polluted.
