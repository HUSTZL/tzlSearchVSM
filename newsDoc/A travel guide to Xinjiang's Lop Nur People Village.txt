A travel guide to Xinjiang's Lop Nur People Village
Besides being a fusion of natural wonders and a connecting point on the Silk Road, Lop Nur People Village in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is home to one of the oldest ethnic groups in the region.

Located 35 kilometers southwest of Yuli County and 85 kilometers south of Korla City, the village covers an area of 72 square kilometers, making it one of the largest villages in western China.

Famous spots and activities

The main attractions here are China's largest desert (Taklamakan Desert), the longest inland river (Tarim River), an ethereal blue lake (Fairy Lake) and a magnanimous forest of golden desert poplar (populus euphratica).

Tourists can not only wade in the river, walk through the forest and ride camels in the desert, but also indulge in hunting, sand skating, fishing and joining the Lop Nur people to sing and dance around the campfire.
