China's central bank issued sets of 10 commemorative coins on Tuesday for the Beijing 2022 Olympic Winter Games. All gold and silver coins feature the official emblem of the 24th Winter Olympics on the obverse, decorated with pictures of the Great Wall and snowflakes. The reverse is inscribed with different designs, including mascots of the 24th Winter Olympics and various ice and snow sports.

Last December, the first set of Beijing 2022 commemorative coins were launched and became very popular.

He Jianghai, deputy secretary-general of the Beijing Organizing Committee for the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games, said that these commemorative coins were an important part of preparations for the Beijing Olympics and will help spread the Olympic spirit, demonstrate Olympic and Chinese traditional culture, as well as promote exchanges and mutual learning between China and other civilizations across the world.
