China issues rules to regulate livestreaming sales
China's authorities have rolled out guidelines to regulate the country's booming livestreaming marketing industry and set standards for livestreaming e-commerce platforms, operators and hosts.

The new measures, jointly issued by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) and six other government entities, including the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism and the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR), aim to protect the rights and interest of consumers and tackle problems including false advertising and goods of poor quality.

They require livestreamers and operators to be at least 16 years old, and minors under 16 must obtain the consent of a legal guardian.

Fake claims in adverts and data fraud, such as bogus comments, likes, views and sales figures, will be banned. Livestreaming platforms are also required to handle complaints from consumers in a timely manner and provide evidence when disputes occur.
