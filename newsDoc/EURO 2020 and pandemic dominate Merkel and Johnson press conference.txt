UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson rejected concerns raised by German Chancellor Angela Merkel during a visit to Britain that big crowds at upcoming Euro 2020 football matches in London could accelerate COVID-19.

Johnson, speaking alongside Merkel at a joint news conference, said that he'd follow the "scientific guidance" and he did not plan to order a reduction in crowds attending matches at Wembley Stadium.

Crowd capacity at Wembley will increase to more than 60,000 fans for the semi-finals and final of Euro 2020 under a pilot scheme announced last week.

"The crucial point is that ... here in the UK, we have built up a very considerable wall of immunity against the disease by our vaccination program," Johnson stated.

"The position is very clear in the UK, which is that we have certain events which we can put on in a very careful and controlled manner with testing of everybody who goes there," he added.

Merkel expressed her worry about European football's governing body UEFA's decision to allow bigger crowds amid a spike in the coronavirus crisis caused by the Delta variant.

"I am worried and skeptical about whether this is good," Merkel said at the same news conference.

On Thursday, the World Health Organization said crowds at Euro 2020 stadiums and in pubs and bars in host cities were driving the current rise in coronavirus infections in Europe.
