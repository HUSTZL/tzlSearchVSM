People celebrate the 4th Chinese farmers' festival across the country
September 23 marks this year's Chinese farmers' harvest festival, and a range of activities are being held across the country to celebrate the bountiful harvest.

Established in 2018, the festival coincides with the autumnal equinox each year, which is one of the 24 solar terms of the Chinese lunar calendar and usually falls between September 22 and 24 during the country's agricultural harvest season.
