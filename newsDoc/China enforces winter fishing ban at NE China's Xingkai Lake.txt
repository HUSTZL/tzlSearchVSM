China enforces winter fishing ban at NE China's Xingkai Lake
Starting November 15, winter fishing in the Xingkai Lake in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province is officially banned, which means all fishing boats are required to evacuate from the site, the local authorities said.

Xingkai Lake is a significant part of the boundary between China and Russia. It is also an important fishing area. The lake is home to 65 fish species, including the famous white fish and white shrimp.

The local police station has strengthened patrols against any illegal fishing activity in the area during the 45-day period.

This is the fishing ban's 69th year since its inception in 1952. Fishing bans are an important measure to protect the aquatic biological resources, according to China's Fisheries Law.

Annual fishing bans are also imposed in other areas in China, such as the Yangtze River and Zhujiang River, to sustain biological resources.
