When winter's first snow meets Beijing's oldest temple
November 7 this year is Lidong, the 19th of China's 24 solar terms, which signifies the beginning of winter. And Tanzhe Temple, the oldest temple in Beijing, has welcomed the arrival of winter with a cold and virgin snow.

The temple sits in the Western Hills, a mountainous area in western Beijing. With little human disturbance and a relatively low temperature, the ancient buildings and old trees can enjoy their exclusive snow scenes longer compared to the city center.

There's an old saying, "there comes first the Tanzhe Temple, then Beijing city." Built in the Jin Dynasty (265¨C420 AD), the temple has witnessed the changes of the ancient city.
