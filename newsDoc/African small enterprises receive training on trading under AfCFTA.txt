African small enterprises receive training on trading under AfCFTA
The International Trade Centre (ITC) said on Tuesday that it has launched a training program for small businesses on how to export within the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).

"The How to Export with the AfCFTA training program is crucial in empowering African small businesses and accelerating intra-African trade. Besides a shortage of working capital, small businesses consistently report difficulties in identifying foreign business opportunities and an inability to analyze export markets as the biggest barriers to exporting," said ITC executive director Pamela Coke-Hamilton.

She said the training program seeks to break down trade barriers for previously under-represented groups and equip small businesses with the skills to seize the export opportunities presented by the AfCFTA.

"Providing them with information, knowledge and tools to overcome the challenges of international trade, the training program will play a pivotal role in enabling them to contribute to the Agreement's success," she added.

The training which will be conducted online includes export readiness, market research, market development, market access conditions, trade finance and international logistics.
