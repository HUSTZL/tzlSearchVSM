Chinese acrobatics school offers online training for foreign trainees
The Hebei Wuqiao Acrobatic Art School in north China recently held an online class for trainees overseas as part of a three-month online training program.



The training program has been tailored for students in Laos and Cambodia and will see the participation of more than 10 acrobatics experts, according to the school.



Owing to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been difficult for acrobatic training classes to meet the demands of trainees in developing countries. Therefore, the school decided to start online training, according to the school authorities.



"Acrobatic training generally uses face-to-face teaching and guidance because of the high requirements of physical movements and details involved," said Duan Yong, an official with the school.
