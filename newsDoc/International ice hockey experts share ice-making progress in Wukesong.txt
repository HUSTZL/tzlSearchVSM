International ice hockey experts share ice-making progress in Wukesong
The Wukesong Sports Center, serving as the ice hockey venue for the 2022 Beijing Winter Games, is undergoing the latest round of ice-making in preparation for test events due to start in early November.

The ice-making process that normally takes about three to five days has begun on Wednesday. According to experts on the field, it is expected to finish by next Monday.

CGTN interviewed ice-making experts from overseas about the ongoing work.

"Yesterday we started, put down some water, and painted that white, so that's the white surface you see behind us," said Nelson Donald-Moffatt from the U.S.

"Today, we are laying out and actually painting out the hockey marks... all the lines, circles and face-off. Progress is pretty good. "

According to Moffatt, making ice requires a strong base that is about two centimeters thick and is usually sprayed over with white paint. After the layer is stable, the lines, circles and face-off will be painted on. Another two-centimeter layer of ice will be added on top to complete the process.
