World's first century-old high-altitude observatory in HK
A historical weather station in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has become the first of its kind to receive accreditation from the World Meteorological Organization. The award recognizes the efforts of facilities that have been accurately tracking the weather for at least a hundred years. Richard Kimber went to visit the station, and has this report.
