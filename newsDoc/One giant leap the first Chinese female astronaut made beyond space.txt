China's Tiangong space station welcomed its first female astronaut Wang Yaping, on October 16. Wang, who has drawn much attention at home and abroad, will become the first Chinese woman to walk in space. Her space trip marks a crucial step on the road of Chinese women's space endeavor. More importantly, it is also the epitome of the country's gigantic achievements of women's social status.

Charles Fourier, French utopian socialist and philosopher, once said that "The degree of emancipation of woman is the natural measure of general emancipation." Given the fact that women make up half of China's huge population, it is beyond doubt that the degree of emancipation and development of Chinese women manifests the progress of the Chinese society.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the social status of Chinese women has been gradually improved with the development of the whole society. The main reason behind China's rapid progress in this respect, is the great importance attached to the development and protection of women's rights and interests by all Chinese leaderships, ranging from Mao Zedong to Xi Jinping.

For example, China's first Constitution, enacted in 1954, stipulated explicitly that women in this country "enjoy equal rights with men in all spheres of life, political, economic, cultural, social and family life." The 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in 2017 also enshrined in the report of the Congress that China would "adhere to the fundamental national policy of gender equality and protect the legitimate rights and interests of women and minors," demonstrating the CPC and the central government's determination to safeguard women's interests.
