China's 5G ambulances offer efficient first-aid services
The application of 5G technology has made smart first-aid service possible, and ambulances equipped with 5G connection have been launched in Beijing.

With 5G communication devices, doctors can make remote diagnoses of critical patients while the ambulance is on the way, and instruct first responders aboard to make pre-surgery preparations while getting ready for necessary operations themselves. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) said at a press conference on Tuesday that more than 600 top-class hospitals across the country have adopted 5G first-aid and remote diagnosis applications.
