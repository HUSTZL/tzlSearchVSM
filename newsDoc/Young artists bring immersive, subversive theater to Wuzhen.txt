Young artists bring immersive, subversive theater to Wuzhen
Aside from the aroma of sticky rice and radish cake, the streets of Wuzhen were filled with serendipitous encounters during its eighth theater festival.

Co-founder and producing director of the festival, Huang Lei, spoke of his hope for the next generation.

"Many young dramatists who appear at the Wuzhen Theatre Festival will shoulder the future of Chinese theater," he said. "The seeds of creativity they sow will take root and bourgeon in every corner of the world."

There was no shortage of Gen-Zers in attendance. Chen Yun'er, a student at the Cambridge School of Visual and Performing Arts, said it was refreshing as a spectator to see such diversity.

"It felt really nice to be 'in the moment' and see so many female representations this year," she shared.
