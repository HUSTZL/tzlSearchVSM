The colorful natural beauty of Tasmania
Tasmania, an off-shore island of Australia, is about 2,500 kilometers north of Antarctica. It is Australia's smallest state in terms of both size and population, yet is a major tourist attraction due to the diverse and spectacular scenery, unexplored wilderness and heritage. Tasmania is geographically and genetically isolated, thus, it is known for its unique geography and ecology.

In this video, we see in the same place a myriad of colors from ginger yellow and tiger orange to violet purple and seafoam green. Tasmania is an island that truly reveals the wonders of nature.

From the squeaky white sand and lichen-splashed granite of the coast, to the bleak alpine plateaus of Mountain-Lake, Tasmania punches well above its weight when it comes to natural beauty.
