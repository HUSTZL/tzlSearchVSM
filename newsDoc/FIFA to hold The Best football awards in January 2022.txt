Football's world governing body FIFA announced that The Best Football Awards ceremony will be held in the Swiss city of Zurich on January 17 2022.

The ceremony will be held virtually in line with ongoing public health measures due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The categories will consist of The Best men's and women's player, coach and goalkeeper awards and the FIFA Pusk¨¢s Award, which is awarded for the best goal of the year.

"In most countries around the world, competitions have resumed under almost normal conditions. Thanks to hard work, solidarity and special measures, football has brought comfort and joy to many people. It is therefore important for FIFA and football across the globe to recognise these performances in the following categories," FIFA said in a statement.

The ceremony will also include other special presentations in recognition of outstanding performances, it added.

The honours will be voted for by all the captains and coaches of international teams, an online ballot of fans and a select number of more than 300 journalists.

Voting will run from November 22 to December 10, while the Ballon d'Or award ceremony will be presented in the French capital Paris on November 29.
