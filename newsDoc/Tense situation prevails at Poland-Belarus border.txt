Tense situation prevails at Poland-Belarus border
The European Union plans to widen sanctions on Belarus over a migrant crisis on its border with Poland. The sanctions include airlines and travel agencies involved in transporting migrants to the bloc's borders. Belarusian Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei calls the sanctions "counter-productive" and says the country is prepared to retaliate.
