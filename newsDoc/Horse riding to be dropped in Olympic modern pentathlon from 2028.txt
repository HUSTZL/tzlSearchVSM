Horse riding to be dropped in Olympic modern pentathlon from 2028
Horse riding will be removed from modern pentathlon's program at the Olympics starting with the Los Angeles Games in 2028, the International Modern Pentathlon Union (UIPM) announced on Thursday, adding that a consultation process to find a suitable replacement will start soon. The decision comes after Germany's modern pentathlon coach Kim Raisner hit a horse at the Tokyo Games this year when it refused to jump a fence. The incident led to widespread criticism of the sport.

"It's not very long since we made a commitment to review and protect the riding discipline in the wake of the rescheduled Tokyo Games. But life within the Olympic movement changes fast," UIPM said in a statement. Animal advocacy group PETA's senior vice-president Kathy Guillermo welcomed the decision but called for change to be effected as soon as the next Summer Olympics in Paris. "We urge the governing board to implement the change in 2024 rather than 2028 ¨C the horses who are whipped and spurred can suffer just as much in three years as in seven," she said. "Horses don't choose to compete and should not be punished because humans do."
