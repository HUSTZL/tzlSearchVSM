CTG holds open house event in Peru
China Three Gorges Corporation (CTG) recently held an online open house event at the San Gaban III Hydroelectric Power Plant in Peru, showcasing its efforts to protect the environment and promote local development during construction.

The power plant has a total installed capacity of 209 megawatts and estimated annual power output of over 1.25 billion kilowatt-hours, which can reduce 338,000 metric tonnes of greenhouse gases.

Once fully operational, the plant is expected to provide clean energy for about 35,000 local residents in southern Peru and boost regional socioeconomic development.
