Lionel Messi said he will return to live in Barcelona with his family when his time at Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) is over and would like to help the La Liga club in the role of a technical director.

Messi ended a two-decade stay at the cash-strapped Spanish club, where he is their record scorer with 672 goals, in the off-season and joined PSG on a free transfer on a two-year deal.

"What is almost confirmed... is that we are going to live in Barcelona again and that our life will be there," the 34-year-old Argentinian told SPORT in an interview published on Monday.

"It's what my wife wants and what I want. I don't know when my contract with PSG ends but we'll go back to Barcelona to live.

"I always said that I would love to be able to help the club... I would love to be a technical director at some point. I don't know if it will be at Barcelona or not.

"If there is a possibility, I would like to contribute again because it's the club that I love and I would love for it to continue doing well, to continue growing and to continue being one of the best in the world."
