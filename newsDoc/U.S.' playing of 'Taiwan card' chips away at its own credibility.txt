U.S.' playing of 'Taiwan card' chips away at its own credibility
The United States and the Taiwan region have recently doubled down on their perilous "Taiwan independence" game. First, Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed U.S. support for "Taiwan's meaningful participation in the UN system."

This is not the first time that the U.S. has been caught red-handed double-dealing on the Taiwan issue. In early August, the U.S. government approved a $750 million arms sale to Taiwan.

The dinghy carrying separatists seeking "Taiwan independence" with U.S. support will only capsize on the raging tide of history. Only by boarding the massive vessel built by the entirety of the Chinese people through national reunification can cross-strait and China-U.S. relations be expected to move forward steadily and safely.
