China refutes media report on plans to replace foreign technology
China didn't formulate plans to replace foreign technology and has always welcomed foreign companies providing technical products and services to China, said Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian on Thursday.



China has always supported economic globalization and promoted the construction of an open world economy, Zhao said, in response to a media report which claimed that China has authorized a government-backed organization to vet and approve local suppliers in an effort to replace foreign technology.
