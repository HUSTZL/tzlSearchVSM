Singles' Day deals begin in China
Shoppers and retailers in China are preparing for one of the biggest shopping days of the year, Singles Day.

The iconic November 11 shopping day started as an anti-Valentine's Day celebration and has since morphed into days of deals and discounts. The final 24hrs of Alibaba's Singles' Day shopping event kicked off on Thursday.

While the company is encouraging "eco-friendly consumption," the day is expected to draw in millions of shoppers.
