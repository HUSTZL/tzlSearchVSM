Sudan military to release all detainees including ousted PM Hamdok
A member of Sudan's newly established Sovereign Council told Al Jazeera that all political detainees, including ousted Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, will be released within a day or two.

Hamdok has been under house arrest since the military takeover on October 25. Sudan's political crisis continues to threaten the country's economy, as the Sudanese people wrestle with high inflation, above-average food prices, and uncertainty over the future. There are some signs of relief though, as market prices stabilize slightly.
