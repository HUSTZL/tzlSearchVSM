China's week-long National Day holiday ending on Thursday, known as the country's "Golden Week", saw flourishing spending in sectors such as duty-free stores, movies, gold and jewelry, despite that travel was restrained by the lingering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

According to the customs data, duty-free consumption in Hainan was up 66.9 percent year-on-year to 1.47 billion yuan (about $228 million) during the holiday. The spending on October 1 alone was up 122 percent compared with last year to 171 million yuan.

Box office receipts during the National Day holiday topped 4.3 billion yuan as of Thursday night, surpassing last year's 3.7 billion yuan, almost approaching 4.4 billion yuan during the holiday in 2019, according to data provider EntGroup.

Domestic brands saw sales boom in gold and jewelry, smart home appliances, as well as cultural and creative products. The sales of jewelry brands like Chow Tai Fook, Lukfook and Chow Sang Sang increased by over 40 percent in the first three days of the holiday. Orders for high-end home appliances on Suning.com increased by 141 percent year on year during the holiday.

Meituan said spending on the platform, including on catering, accommodation, tourism, entertainment and travel, increased 29.5 percent during this year's National Day holiday compared to last year and went up by 51.6 percent compared with 2019.

Data released by China UnionPay on Friday also showed that 2.72 trillion yuan worth of online transactions were handled during the holiday, with average daily transactions surging by 31.7 percent compared with the National Day holiday in 2020.
