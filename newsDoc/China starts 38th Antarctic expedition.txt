China starts 38th Antarctic expedition
China embarked on its 38th Antarctic scientific expedition with the first batch of 154 members setting off from Shanghai on board the polar icebreaker Xuelong on Friday.

The members will carry out research on atmospheric composition, hydrometeorology and ecological environment in response to global climate change.

They will also monitor microplastics, floating garbage and other new pollutants in the Southern Ocean and provide rotational staff and supplies at China's Zhongshan and Great Wall stations in the Antarctic.

The team is expected to return home in mid-April 2022.
