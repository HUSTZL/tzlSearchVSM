An open house event was recently held at the Assac Wind Farm in southern France to give residents an opportunity to learn how wind power promotes development.

The wind farm was developed and is operated by CGN Europe Energy, a subsidiary of China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN).

The event welcomed 250 pupils from nearby schools and local farmers. The mayor of the Assac municipality mentioned that a hiking path has become an industrial tourism project based on the wind farm project and has attracted many tourists.
