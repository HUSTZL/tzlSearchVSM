Let's Party
One hundred years ago, a small red boat sailed through turbulent rivers and treacherous shoals, turning a new page in Chinese history. Owing to the firm leadership of the Communist Party of China, the whole world witnessed the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Today, under the CPC's leadership, China is advancing toward the center stage of the world with unstoppable momentum. The little red boat has evolved into a giant ship that steers China steadily on. A hundred years on from its founding, the Communist Party of China is still in its prime.
