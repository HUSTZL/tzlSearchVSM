UK works on first deep geothermal power plant
More than 40 percent of the UK's electricity now comes from renewable sources, including wind turbines and solar panels. So far, though, Britain has no deep geothermal power plants in operation and is lagging other European countries when it comes to harnessing the power of underground heat.

There is, however, one geothermal power plant currently under construction in Cornwall, in southwest England, aimed at providing heat and electricity for the Eden Project, one of the region's top tourist attractions.

The Eden Project is home to the world's largest indoor rainforest housed beneath huge geodesic domes which are, in effect, giant greenhouses. Thousands of exotic tropical trees and plants cover an area the size of three soccer pitches, which, pre-COVID-19, attracted more than a million visitors a year.

It takes a lot of energy to keep the rainforest hot and humid, with temperatures up to 35 degrees Celsius. In a bid to make the Eden Project totally reliant on renewable energy the company decided to go for a geothermal solution.

David Harland, interim CEO for the Eden Project, said: "There are all sorts of renewable technology. Geothermal is baseload, so really important that it's on basically all of the time. Whereas solar and wind, which are great technologies, don't get me wrong, but you know the sun has to shine and the wind has to blow."

The other advantage, he felt, was that it also has a very small footprint when operational and doesn't dominate the landscape like wind turbines.

Work is now well under way a short distance from the domes. A drilling rig, similar to those used to find onshore oil, is boring down through the tough granite rock to access the earth's natural heat deep underground.
