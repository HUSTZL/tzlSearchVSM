An aerial view of the China's colorful Aibi Lake
Aibi Lake, or Ebi Lake, is the largest saltwater lake in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. In Mongolian, its name means "the lake facing toward the sun." Dzungarian Gate, which is known for strong winds, is to its west. According to locals, the lake water can be blown as far as one kilometer away from the shore on windy days.

At the mouth of Aibi Lake, the Jinghe River enters the lake from the northern slope of the Tianshan Mountain, leaving a footprint like the roots of a giant tree. The red seepweed and green seagrass make the wetland a colorful wildlife paradise.
