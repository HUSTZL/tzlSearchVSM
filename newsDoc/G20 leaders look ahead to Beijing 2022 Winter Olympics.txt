Last month, Bach expressed his confidence in China's hosting the Games. "The preparations are going very, very well," he said in an interview with the China Media Group (CMG). "We are deeply impressed in the way that China was handling the COVID-19 pandemic, the IOC president said. "The determination, not only to contain the virus, but to eradicate the virus, we could see a lot of Chinese efficiency in all these efforts. "Nevertheless, at the same time, the preparations for the Games have made progress despite all the restrictions related to the pandemic. And this is really impressive to see that all the venues have already been finished some months ago."
