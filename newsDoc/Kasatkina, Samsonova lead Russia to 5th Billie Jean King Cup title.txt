Russia claimed their fifth Billie Jean King Cup title on Saturday after Daria Kasatkina and Liudmila Samsonova handed them an unbeatable 2-0 lead over Switzerland.

After Kasatkina had romped to a 6-2 6-4 win over Jil Teichmann, Samsonova held her nerve despite being a late replacement for the injured Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova to defeat Belinda Bencic 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 and secure Russia their first title since 2008 in the women's team competition.

Samsonova raised her arms in victory and was embraced by her teammates, while American great Billie Jean King watched on from the stands.

"It is unbelievable. It was an incredible fight," an emotional Samsonova said on court.
