Birds of prey battle against gull family in northern China
A peregrine falcon and a western osprey were captured on camera Sunday taking up with a family of black-headed gulls near the coast of north China's Hebei Province. But the two stories ended very differently.

The falcon, known as the fastest bird of prey in the world, was able to snatch a black-headed gull for lunch. The osprey, looking to have as much as as the falcon, was immediately driven away by about six gulls from the family and forced to surrender.
