The Chinese herb that helps prevent alcohol abuse
If you have been to Jiangxi Province in east China, you might have sampled the gelatinous kudzu beverage that people drink at mealtime. These delicate purple blossoms growing in Ganzhou City in the province are the flowers of kudzu. Chinese use the plant's roots to treat cough, flu and hypertension, and help prevent alcohol abuse.

The name kudzu often refers to one or more species in the genus Pueraria, a plant widely found in China, except northwestern Qinghai Province and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and southwestern Tibet Autonomous Region.
