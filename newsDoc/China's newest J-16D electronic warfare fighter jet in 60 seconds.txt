China's newest J-16D electronic warfare fighter jet in 60 seconds
China's most advanced electronic warfare fighter jet, the J-16D, made its debut at Airshow China 2021. China independently designed and manufactured the J-16D based on the previous-generation J-16 fighter, aiming to jam enemy radar and erode anti-aircraft systems. The plane features an electronic warfare pod under each wing, and its fuselage bristles with antennas. There are also hardpoints under the plane to attach anti-radiation missiles (ARM) that can target hostile radar. China is the second country to develop this type of electronic warfare fighter, after the United States. The unveiling of the J-16D highlights China's vastly improved electronic warfare capabilities.
