Electric car sales surge in China but infrastructure lags behind
More than 3 million electric and hybrid cars are expected to be sold this year in China, taking up half of the global share, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) predicted in October. However, a lack of charging facilities on motorways holds back some consumers from buying electric cars.

The CAAM also expected the 2021 sales volume of electric and hybrid cars would double that of last year.

Shenzhen-based battery and electric car manufacturer BYD saw monthly sales of new energy cars triple in October to 80,003 units. The company said that both all-electric and hybrid models contributed to the surge.

BYD's hybrids dominated the global market a month earlier, taking up two spots in the top 10 best-selling list. Total electric car sales topped Elon Musk's Tesla and the budget Wuling Hongguang mini EV ¨C a joint venture with General Motors.

"We've benefited from the explosive growth in the overall market. Some 334,000 electric cars were sold in China in September ... a fifth of all new cars," said Brian Luo, director of BYD's branding and PR division.

He attributed the jump in sales to technologies such as the Blade Battery and the DM-i super hybrid system.

"And our range has increased to 1,200 kilometers on a single charge," he added.

China is promoting electric cars, which could help reduce air pollution and climate change, with policies to restrict new petrol plates and subsidies to buyers.

"Those are the policies that shift consumption," said Wu Haifeng, assistant professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen.

Wu himself drives a plug-in hybrid SUV by Volkswagen. The German auto giant recently began construction on its third Chinese factory designed to produce electric cars.
