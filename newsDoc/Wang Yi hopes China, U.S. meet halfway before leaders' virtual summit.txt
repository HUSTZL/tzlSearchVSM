Wang Yi hopes China, U.S. meet halfway before leaders' virtual summit
Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi has called on China and the U.S. to meet each other halfway to ensure a successful virtual summit between their two leaders and bring bilateral ties back to the right track.

Wang made the remarks in a phone conversation with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Saturday, shortly after the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced that the video meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Joe Biden will take place on Tuesday morning.
