'Competition and collaboration' key to China-UK firms' climate action
Chinese and UK businesses have set out the benefits of working together to tackle climate change in a new report. Companies from a range of industries highlighted collaboration that was helping to reduce emissions in both countries and even further afield in a document published by the China Britain Business Council (CBBC). British bus maker Alexander Dennis is working with China's BYD to source hydrogen fuel cells, while UK national weather service, the Met Office, has teamed up with Chinese forecasters and academics to produce models of how extreme climate events will impact cities.

The business council's chair, Sherard Cowper-Coles, said the two countries were ideal partners. "The case for deeper collaboration between the two nations has never been stronger. China is a fellow world leader in this race; Chinese firms are working hard to support the UK and the goals of COP26 both at home in China and the UK, in third markets and on the world stage. And there is certainly space for healthy competition and collaboration within our relationship." The largest producer of renewable energy in the world, China this year overtook the UK in offshore wind capacity. By 2022 it will be home to two-thirds of all the world's electrolyzers needed to produce clean hydrogen and by 2025 is set to have twice the battery production of the rest of the world combined.
