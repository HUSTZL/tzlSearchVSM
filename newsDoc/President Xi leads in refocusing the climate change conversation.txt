Chinese President Xi Jinping has been the center of attention in the last few days. As the leader of the world's second largest economy, Xi's remarks at global summits have drawn major attention as other leaders, as well as analysts, assess his thinking about the direction in which the world needs to go to avoid total destruction.

In his address to the event, Xi avoided the sideshows and dealt with the reality of the worsening situation. Rather than point fingers or engage in defensiveness, his conciliatory message was universal, stressing the need to adhere to multilateralism, take practical action and accelerate green transformation.

He also stepped in for developing countries by asking the developed world to step up the former's capacity to thwart the vagaries of climate change. This is an obligation that needs to be taken seriously as poor countries are low carbon emitters but ironically some of the biggest victims of the repercussions.

China has never shunned its onerous responsibilities in tackling pollution, just like many of the largest global economies. This is not even a matter of debate but is an obvious by-product of a growing economy.

But unlike others who are in denial, the country has constantly spelled out measures that it has instituted to mitigate the damage caused by the hitherto inevitable carbon emissions, and its commitment to curb and alleviate the consequent climate change.
