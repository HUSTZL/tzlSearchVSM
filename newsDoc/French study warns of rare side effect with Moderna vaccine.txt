French study warns of rare side effect with Moderna vaccine
France has become the latest country to issue a warning about an extremely rare, but potentially fatal side effect of Moderna¡¯s vaccine in under-30s.

The drug has been approved for people over the age of 18 in both the European Union and in the U.S.

But its approval for younger people in the U.S has been delayed over similar concerns about myocarditis ¨C inflammation of the heart muscle.
