Hong Kong Disneyland reopened on Thursday after being closed for a day over safety concerns following a visit by a confirmed COVID-19 patient.

The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) provided free nucleic acid testing service to the people who needed to be tested.

The park administration closed the park Tuesday night to ensure staff and visitors complete tests as soon as possible.

The park said on its website that it would continue to implement health and safety measures, including requiring all guests to take temperature checks, wear masks, and use mobile phones to scan QR codes or register contact details when entering the park as required by law.
