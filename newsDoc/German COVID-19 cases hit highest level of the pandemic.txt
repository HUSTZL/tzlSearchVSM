German COVID-19 cases hit highest level of the pandemic
The rate of COVID-19 infection in Germany has risen to the highest level recorded during the pandemic.

Data released Monday shows the country's latest 7-day incidence rate has hit 201 cases per 100,000 people.

The previous high was reached on December 22 last year, when vaccines were not widely available.

The spike in cases is raising questions about whether certain restrictions may need to return over winter. Senior politicians want to avoid a fresh lockdown, but some regional leaders have not ruled out the measure in areas with particularly high caseloads.

"If we take too much time now, it will end in a lockdown like last year," Saxony Premier Michael Kretschmer said in an interview with local radio outlet, Deutschlandfunk.
