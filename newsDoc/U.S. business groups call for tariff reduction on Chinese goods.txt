U.S. business groups call for tariff reduction on Chinese goods
Over 20 American business associations are urging the White House to reduce tariffs on Chinese goods. In a letter addressed to U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, the group requested immediate action to ease economic harm to U.S. businesses, farmers and workers. The letter was sent just days before the virtual meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Joe Biden. Washington is imposing tariffs of up to 25 percent on more than $300 billion worth of Chinese imported goods.
