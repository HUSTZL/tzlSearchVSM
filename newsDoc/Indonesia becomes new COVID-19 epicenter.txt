Indonesia has become the new epicenter for COVID-19 and now has the world's highest number of new infections.

Cases and deaths in the country have skyrocketed with the delta variant.

Many hospitals are on the verge of collapse and medical supplies are running low.

Some health experts say, the official count of cases is vastly understated because of limited testing.

Indonesian officials say they have the virus under control.
