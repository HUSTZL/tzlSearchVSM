Re-introducing bison to Romania after 200-year absence
Currently, there are more than 100 bison roaming the forests in the South East of Romania after a centuries-long absence.

The reintroduction of these bison shows the success of a seven-year project from the World Wildlife Fund and Rewilding Europe. This highlights a key target to prevent Europe's largest land mammal from entering the critically endangered species list.

Historically, bison were wiped out by hunting and habitat destruction. The first bison of the new generation was welcomed in 2014 in the southwestern Armenis region, 200 years after its ancestors last roamed that part of the world.
