Full moon seen on Tuesday morning across China
Did you see the full moon?

This year's "roundest and fullest" moon of the Mid-Autumn Festival made an appearance at 7:55 a.m. Beijing Time on Tuesday. Here we present some of the pictures taken by Chinese photographers in the wee hours of the day and the preceding night.

Per Chinese folklore, the moon sometimes appears the fullest on the 16th of the lunar month, instead of the 15th. However, Chinese astronomers have agreed that for the years 2021 to 2023, the moon will be full on the date expected and not after.
