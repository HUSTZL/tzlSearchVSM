A close look at cotton harvest in China's Xinjiang
It's cotton harvest season again in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Let's take a close look at the harvest in Awat County, Aksu Prefecture.

Dubbed the "Cotton Town," Awat County has a long history of cotton planting. The county boasts high-quality cotton and high-efficiency production. It produces one-fifth of the world's long-staple cotton with silkier, lustrous and more durable fibers, filling markets from Europe to North America.
