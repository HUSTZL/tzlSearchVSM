China an advocate, promoter, practitioner in global health cooperation
China has always actively participated in global health governance and promoted health cooperation, Margaret Chan Fung Fu-chun, former director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO), told the Chinese newspaper Global Times in an interview on Monday.

Since 1972 when the country's lawful seat in the WHO was restored, China has had long and effective cooperation with the United Nations agency, during which process the two have enjoyed mutual benefits, said Chan, who is the emeritus director-general of the WHO and founding dean of the Vanke School of Public Health at Tsinghua University.

She said China has made remarkable progress in deepening medical reform, health promotion and basic medical insurance domestically and has continuously provided medical personnel, technology, training and other assistance to countries in need.

"Whether it is universal health coverage or the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, China has been pushing for all-round implementation," Chan said, adding that the country has grown from being a beneficiary of global health cooperation to "an active builder and contributor."

She listed some of the contributions China has made to international public health, including helping developing countries set up clinics and build African Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, joining in the fight against yellow fever in Guyana and Ebola in West Africa, and assisting with natural disasters, such as the cyclone in the Philippines and earthquakes in Nepal.

"All this shows that China has become an advocate, promoter and practitioner of international cooperation in the field of healthcare and is committed to the implementation of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development," said Chan.

Looking into the future, Chan said China will continue to work with the WHO in the field of health to jointly promote global health cooperation and deepen its contribution to global health.
