NW China welcomes its elegant old friends
More than 20 swans were recently seen playing and foraging on a local lake in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.

They stopped over at the Ulungur Lake, a temporary stop for the migratory birds heading south.

The swans, mainly whooper and mute swans, will continue to fly southward after the lake is completely frozen.

Through the veil of the morning mist, the elegant gestures presented by the swans created a stunning fairyland with charming scenery, providing a magnificently visible feast to the local birdwatchers.
