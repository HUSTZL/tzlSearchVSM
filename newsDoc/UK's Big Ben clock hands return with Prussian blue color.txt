UK's Big Ben clock hands return with Prussian blue color
The hands, which were removed three years ago, have been restored to their original Prussian blue color as restoration craftsmen discovered that the clock hands were originally painted blue rather than black. The craftsmen have also refurbished the stonework, re-glazed the clock dials and repainted the ironwork since 2017. /CFP
