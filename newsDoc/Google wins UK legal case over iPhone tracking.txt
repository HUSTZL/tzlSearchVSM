Google wins UK legal case over iPhone tracking
Britain's highest court on Wednesday blocked a class action against Google, accused of illegally tracking millions of iPhone users.

The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom (SCUK) said in a statement that it "unanimously dismisses" the legal action brought by campaigners against the U.S. based tech giant on behalf of 4.4 million people in England and Wales.
