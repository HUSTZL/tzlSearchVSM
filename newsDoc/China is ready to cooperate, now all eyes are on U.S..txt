China is ready to cooperate, now all eyes are on U.S.
Editor's note: CGTN's First Voice provides instant commentary on breaking stories. The daily column clarifies emerging issues and better defines the news agenda, offering a Chinese perspective on the latest global events.

Despite their differences, the world's two largest economies can and must cooperate. Bearing this in mind, Chinese President Xi Jinping is to hold a virtual meeting with his U.S. counterpart Joe Biden next week on issues of common concern.

The top-level engagement comes amid heightened tensions on the Taiwan issue, the South China Sea and so-called human rights concerns.

China, as a responsible power, is keen to avoid conflicts. Its door to talks is open at any time. With high-level interactions in Anchorage, Tianjin and Zurich, the Chinese government has shown its sincerity towards improving ties with Washington. The upcoming meeting is another gesture of Beijing's goodwill and an attempt to responsibly manage the differences between the two countries.

Washington tries to shape its image as a responsible power at the negotiating table, but has been acting the other way round on certain issues. Talking about cooperation, the U.S. has frequently promoted militarization of the South China Sea, repeatedly provoked the Chinese government on the one-China principle and attempted to intervene into China's domestic affairs. Such behavior has put the China-U.S. relationship into a downward spiral.
