Zlatan Ibrahimovic described his 150th Serie A goal from a free-kick as an "old age" shot as AC Milan beat Jose Mourinho's Roma 2-1 on Sunday to remain second on goal difference in the table behind Napoli.

The Sweden striker, who turned 40 earlier this month, also thought he had scored his 400th goal in domestic leagues but was denied a second of the encounter with VAR finding offside in the second half.

Stefano Pioli's side finished the game down a man as left-back Theo Hernandez was shown a red card for a shoulder challenge.

"Every now and then, I pull a surprise! You must always give it a go, as failure is part of success, so you keep trying," Ibrahimovic told DAZN about his free-kick clocked at 101km/h. "It usually goes quicker! At least 200kmh! I think I must be slowing my shot in old age," he added.

Earlier, Poland midfielder Piotr Zielinski scored as league leaders Napoli overcame lowly Salernitana. Zielinski claimed his second goal of the season with half an hour left at the Arechi Stadium as both sides finished with 10 men.

Elsewhere on Sunday, Joaquin Correa's slick second-half double earned Inter Milan a 2-0 win over Udinese to consolidate the defending champions' hold on third place. Serbia attacker Dusan Vlahovic scored a hat-trick to take his goal tally for the season to 10 in 12 games as Fiorentina beat Spezia 3-0.
