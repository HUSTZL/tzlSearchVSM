Novak Djokovic, making his return to the court at the Paris Masters, seven weeks after losing the U.S. Open final, picked up a doubles win on Monday, on the eve of his singles debut.

Djokovic and Serbian compatriot Filip Krajinovic needed a super tie-break to beat Australians Alex de Minaur and Luke Saville 4-6, 6-4, 10/7, in front of a packed Bercy arena.

"I've never played in front of so many people for a doubles match, it's incredible," said the world number one, whose last doubles match was in Mallorca in June when he and Carlos Gomez-Herrera won their semifinal. They then withdrew from the final because the Spaniard had injured an ankle.

In his first singles match on Tuesday, Djokovic will face Hungarian Marton Fucsovics, who beat Italian Fabio Fognini 6-1, 6-7 (6/8), 7-6 (7/5) on Monday.
