China handed kind draw in AFC Women's Asian Cup 2022
Eight-time winners China were handed a favorable draw in the 2022 AFC Women's Asian Cup on Thursday, with hosts India, Chinese Taipei and Iran standing in their way on the road to ultimate glory, while defending champions Japan will face South Korea, Vietnam and Myanmar in their group. World number 11 and 2010 champions Australia will have to get past Thailand, Philippines and Indonesia to advance to the knockout stages of the tournament, which will be held in Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Pune from January 20 to February 6, 2022, with 25 matches played across 17 days.

The top two teams in each group, as well as two of the best third-place finishers, will progress to the quarterfinals.

The top five teams of the tournament, besides 2023 hosts Australia, will win spots at the 2023 Women's World Cup with the following two advancing to the play-offs.



As hosts of the 2022 AFC Women's Asian Cup, there is a certain level of expectation for India, currently ranked 57th in the world, and they will be looking to replicate the achievements of 1979, when they last hosted the showpiece event and made it to the final. India have twice been runners-up at the Women's Asian Cup in 1979 and 1983.
