China successfully launched three new remote-sensing satellites from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in the country's southwestern Sichuan Province at 11:00 a.m. (Beijing Time) on Saturday.

The satellites (members of the Yaogan-35 family) were sent into orbit atop a Long March-2D carrier rocket.
