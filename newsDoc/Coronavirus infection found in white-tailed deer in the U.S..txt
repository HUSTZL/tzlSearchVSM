Concerns are rising after a recent study from the U.S. found that more white-tailed deer had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19.

A new study released on biorxiv.org, an online preprint repository for the biological sciences, has found that 94 percent of sampled deer in the U.S. state of Iowa from April to November 2020 tested positive for active SARS-CoV-2 infection. Such a high level of virus detection led researchers to conclude a likely result "from multiple human-to-deer spillover events and deer-to-deer transmission."

Jennifer Ramsey, wildlife veterinarian for Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks (FWP), was quoted by the Billings Gazette newspaper Monday as saying that a recently released study, which found about one-third of 283 captive and free-ranging deer had tested positive for the infection, rose concerns about deer being a reservoir for the virus to mutate.

"There's a lot of uncertainty about how deer are getting exposed, and what this will mean for wildlife and humans over time," she said.
