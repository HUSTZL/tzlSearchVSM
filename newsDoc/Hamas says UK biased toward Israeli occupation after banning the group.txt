Hamas says UK biased toward Israeli occupation after banning the group
A Hamas official on Friday accused the UK of being biased towards the Israeli occupation after it proscribed the militant group as a "terrorist organization."

Hamas political official Sami Abu Zuhri said Britain's move is a "submission to Israeli blackmail and dictations."

British Home Secretary Priti Patel on Friday said she had moved to ban Hamas in its entirety, claiming the group "has the significant terrorist capability, including access to extensive and sophisticated weaponry, as well as terrorist training facilities."
