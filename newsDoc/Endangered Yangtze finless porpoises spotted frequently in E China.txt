Endangered Yangtze finless porpoises spotted frequently in E China
Yangtze finless porpoises have been spotted frequently in the Nanjing section of the Yangtze River in east China's Jiangsu Province recently. Many residents in the city as Jiangsu's provincial capital have seen the scene of the beautiful creatures playing or leaping out of water.

The Yangtze finless porpoise is an endangered species under first-class state protection in China. Its presence is an important indicator of the ecological state of the Yangtze River, so the frequent appearances indicate a pleasant living environment in the Nanjing section.

"We have been conducting investigation and statistical analysis of the population of the Yangtze finless porpoise in the Nanjing section of the Yangtze River. Based on our findings in recent years, especially since 2017, there is a population of about 50 finless porpoises living steadily in the Nanjing section," said Yang Guang, vice chairman of Science and Technology Committee of China Wildlife Conservation Association.
