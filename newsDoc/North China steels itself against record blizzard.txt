Chinese authorities say they have resolved to tackle strong snowstorms wreaking havoc and disrupting life in the country's northern regions.

Blizzard conditions, which began on Sunday, have brought record snowfall.

Shenyang, the capital city of northeastern Liaoning Province, had by Tuesday logged average snowfall of 51 millimeters and a maximum snow depth of 41 centimeters, a record since 1905, meteorological officials said.

Traffic in the province has been severely disrupted, with most expressway toll stations remaining closed on Tuesday. Passenger stations also remain shuttered, except those in the cities of Dalian and Dandong.

Solid efforts are underway to clear snow from transport routes in a bid to ensure transportation security and safeguard people's livelihoods, the authorities say Shenyang has mobilized about 24,000 people, with over 2,000 sets of machinery and equipment running at full steam to clear the expressway.
