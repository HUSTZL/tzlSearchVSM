World No. 1 Novak Djokovic will play in both men's singles and doubles at the Paris Masters next week, rekindling the rest of this season after losing to Daniil Medvedev in the U.S. Open final in September.

Djokovic has won this Masters 1000 event five times. He will be teaming up with compatriot Filip Krajinovic for the doubles match this time, as he takes advantage of this tournament to prepare for the Davis Cup due to kick off in late November.

The 34-year-old Serb will start his singles bid in Bercy against either Italian Fabio Fognini or Hungarian Marton Fucsovics.
