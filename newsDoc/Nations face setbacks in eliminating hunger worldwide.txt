The globe will likely miss its target of eliminating hunger by 2030.

While global hunger levels have been declining since 2000, COVID-19, climate change and conflict are slowing down and in some cases, reversing progress, according to the Global Health Index (GHI), an NGO tool used to measure and track hunger worldwide.

Undernutrition is also rising after decades of decline.

The GHI factors in undernourishment, child wasting, child stunting and child mortality rates to rank a country on the index.

The 2021 GHI shows 47 out of 135 countries assessed are unlikely to reach even low levels of hunger by 2030 and more than half of undernourished people live in fragile states or countries facing conflict and violence.

Countries with a score of 50 or more on a 100-point scale are classified as experiencing an "extremely alarming" level of hunger

With a 50.8 score, Somalia is the only country currently experiencing this level of hunger, according to the index.

Five countries - Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Madagascar and Yemen - are experiencing "alarming" hunger levels.

The index also indicates conflict is the main factor behind hunger in 80% of countries with "serious" or "alarming" hunger levels.

And experts warn, hunger is expected to increase as the pandemic continues.

Up to 811 million people faced chronic hunger and 155 million more faced an acute food crisis by the end of 2020.

But work can still be done to mitigate hunger and its impact worldwide.

To improve food access and hunger levels, the GHI suggests nations promote peace, climate-resilient and diversified farming practices and local, national and international cooperation.

Nations should also provide social protections, transparency and anchor multilateral food governance in human rights and inclusive participation in society.
